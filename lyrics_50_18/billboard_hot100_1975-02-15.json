Thunder and lightning couldn't be bolder I'll write on your tombstone, I thank you for dinner This game that we animals play is a winner  Let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me I'm a tiger when I want love But I'm a snake if we disagree  {Bridge}  The rivers are full of crocodile nasties And He who made kittens put snakes in the grass He's a lover of life but a player of pawns Yes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn To light up His Jungle as play is resumed The monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune  Let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me I'm a tiger when I want love But I'm a snake if we disagree  Let's bungle in the jungle Well, that's all right by me I'm a tiger when I want love But I'm a snake if we disagree  ",
