Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it  Oh, why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it  The reflex is a lonely child, who's waiting by the park The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre? And every little thing the reflex does Leaves you answered with a question mark  I'm on a ride and I want to get off But they won't slow down the roundabout I sold the Renoir and TV set Don't wanna be around when this gets out  So, why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it  Why don't you use it?  The reflex is a lonely child, he's waiting in the park The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre? And every little thing the reflex does Leaves an answer with a question mark, play  So, why don't you use it? Try not to bruise it Buy time, don't lose it  The reflex is a lonely child who's waiting by the park The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre? And every little thing the reflex does Leaves me answered with a question mark  Oh, the reflex, what a game, he's hiding all the cards The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark  ",
