You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again? Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?

Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me\u2026  [Hook: Erykah Badu] If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or What club I went to with my homies Baby, don't worry You know that you got me  [Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve] Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night And that's when she flip And get on some old\u2026 another lonely night Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic I know you gotta get that paper Daddy, keep that shit tight But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me? While politicking with my sister from New York City She said she know this ball player And he think I'm pretty\u2014psych, I'm playin', boo You know it's just with you I'm staying, boo And when cats be poppin' game I don't hear what they sayin', boo When you out there in the world I'm still your girl With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme And don't be listening to your homies They be leadin' you blind Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you? Is you crazy?! You my king for real But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt  [Hook: Erykah Badu] If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or What club I went to with my homies Baby, don't worry You know that you got me  [Verse 3: Black Thought] That snake could be that chick And that rat could be that cool cat That's whispering, \"She trying to play you for the fool, Black.\" If something's on your chest, then let it be known See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact That people bite back and fracture what's intact And they'll forever be, I ain't on some \"Oh, I'm a celebrity!\" I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends That's exactly the point where their whole world ends Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like\u2026  [Hook: Erykah Badu] If you were worried 'bout where I been or who I saw or What club I went to with my homies Baby, don't worry You know that you got me  ",
