Tomorrow, so they say Will be a lovely day A bright new sun will suddenly break through But I don't want to see tomorrow Unless I see it with you  Tomorrow, so I hear The clouds will disappear The door to happiness will open wide But I don't want to see tomorrow Unless you're there by my side  Don't want to walk alone Don't want to dream alone Just want you close to my heart For if your love is gone How can I face the dawn of Sunday, or Monday? I just can't face one day...  Until you say you're mine Oh, darling, please be mine And make each bright tomorrow young and new But I don't want to face tomorrow Unless I see it with you  (Tomorrow, so I hear The clouds will disappear The door to happiness will open wide.) But I don't want to see tomorrow Unless I see it with you  ",
