Aimed at your average teen  How about a pair of pink sidewinders And a bright orange pair of pants? \"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby If you just give it half a chance Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey?

I'm wondering where the lions are...  Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take Pointing a finger at eternity I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy  Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun (should be!) they got me thinking about eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me And I'm wondering where the lions are... I'm wondering where the lions are...  Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay One of these days we're going to sail away Going to sail into eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me And I'm wondering where the lions are... I'm wondering where the lions are...  ",
