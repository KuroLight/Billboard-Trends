Listen  [Verse 1: Joe Budden] Let me tell you how I pictured this A few houses, a couple businesses Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses And during beef, we both would put aside our differences Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it She a synergy, sharing energy Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me Now here's what I did with it Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks Lost good girls making them mistresses Just savages, missed marriages They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages My worthless self when Joe felt hurt I went out and targeted women who had no self worth I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit Her next sentence swear that I\u2019ll forever hold with a grip She said it go by even faster as the older you get I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss Now neither one of us is how we figured we\u2019d be Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me I always pictured we'd be  [Interlude: Joe Budden] Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though. Ain't quite pan out like that. Word up. Let me tell you about some more of God's work though  [Hook: Stacy Barthe] I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know  [Interlude: Joe Budden] Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run Lemme go right here, right here, right here Look, Look  [Verse 2: Joe Budden] A love that's tideful, never prideful If you're truly better without me how can I spite you? As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there I respect your mom's tutelage But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this? Watch and learn, foolish kid Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am Look, same pedigree, theoretically Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically One job in life to make you a much better me Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it My hands were in bondage, useless Beyond the excuses, calm through it It\u2019s crazy, our bond music And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit So right now I stand in a place I never stood before Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for Now it's better than we pictured it'd be And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it Little nigga we'll be  [Interlude] This is greater than us. Greater than me. Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man. I ain't talking to everbody. Trey, what up though? What up? What up?  [Hook: Stacy Barthe] I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know  ",

It's the return of the \"Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?\" And Dr. Dre said\u2026 nothing, you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!) Feminist women love Eminem \"Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who,\" \"Yeah, but he's so cute though.\" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose \"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammals\u2014well, some of us, cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes\u2014  [Hook] I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me \"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\" Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV \"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.\" I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me  [Hook] 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?
