You feel it in your chest You keep my mind at ease and my soul at rest You're not vexed Look to the sky where my help come from Seen it circling around from the mountain Thunder!

Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for When they know they're your heart, and you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of her pain? \"Daddy, look what I made!\" \"Dad's gotta go catch a plane\" \"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?\" \"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself\" Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby  [Chorus] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang, so, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back  [Verse 2] I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming she don't want me to sing \"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?\" \"Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more\" \"Daddy, you're lyin'! You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine!\" She's piling boxes in front of the door, tryna block it \"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!\" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, \"This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!\" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man, I can hear 'em They're saying, \"You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late!\" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing\u2014  [Chorus] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back  [Verse 3] Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin' out They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' \"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!\" But, Baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? \"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'.\" But baby, wait! \u2014 \"It's too late, Dad, you made the choice Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.\" I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me? I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain, scream \"Die, Shady!\" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes And burns to ashes; that's when I wake up Alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles, and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say  [Chorus] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thang So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back  *Curtains Closing*  ",
