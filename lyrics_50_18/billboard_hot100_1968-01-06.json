Side by side two people stand Together vowing, hand-in-hand That love's imbedded in their hearts But soon an empty feeling starts To overwhelm their hollow lives And when they seek the hows and whys Who will answer?  On a strange and distant hill A young man's lying very still His arms will never hold his child Because a bullet running wild Has struck him down. And now we cry \"Dear God, Oh, why, oh, why?\" But who will answer?  High upon a lonely ledge A figure teeters near the edge And jeering crowds collect below To egg him on with, \"Go, man, go!\" But who will ask what led him To his private day of doom And who will answer?

Who will answer?  'Neath the spreading mushroom tree The world revolves in apathy As overhead, a row of specks Roars on, drowned out by discotheques And if a secret button's pressed Because one man has been outguessed Who will answer?  Is our hope in walnut shells Worn 'round the neck with temple bells Or deep within some cloistered walls Where hooded figures pray in halls? Or crumbled books on dusty shelves Or in our stars, or in ourselves Who will answer?

So, don't look around Get your feet on the ground It's much better by far To be just who you are  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But just be thankful for what you've got  Many times, it seems to me There's someone else I'd rather be Living in a world of make-believe To stay in bed 'til nearly three With nothing there to worry me Would seem to be the life I might achieve  But deep inside, I know I'm really lucky With happiness I've never known before And just as long as you are there beside me I know that I could ask for nothing more  Then living can start With the love in your heart So, with you all the time All the treasures I've longed for are mine  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But I'm so thankful for what I've got  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But I'm so thankful for what I've got  ",
