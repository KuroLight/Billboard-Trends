And I just happened to find your name and number... So woman to woman, I don't think it's wrong to call Now, I don't know how you're gonna take this... You might even hang up the phone... But, you see, it really doesn't make any difference... And it's only fair that I let you know... That \"that man\" you've been seeing... He's mine...and I love him... So woman to woman I think you'll understand  Woman to woman If you've ever been in love Then you know how I feel And woman to woman Now if you were in my shoes Wouldn't you have done the same thing too?  Woman to woman I've just got to make you see Woman to woman That you can't take him from me Woman to woman I just can't step aside And let you take what is rightfully mine  Woman to woman Right or wrong I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home I hope you understand... I love that man... And he's mine  Woman to woman If you've ever been in love Then you know how I feel Woman to woman Now if you were in my shoes Wouldn't you have done the same thing too?
