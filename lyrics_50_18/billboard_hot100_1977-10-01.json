Nothing left for me, ain't there nothing left for me  [Hook] Baby come back, any kind of fool could see There was something in everything about you Baby come back, listen baby, you can blame it all on me I was wrong, and I just can't live without you I was wrong, and I just can't live  [Outro] Baby come back, any kind of fool could see There was something in everything about you Baby come back, you can blame it all on me  ",

Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers I ain't never run into no Martian Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat  Well, he was sitting over there with a Bunch of colored sticks on his plate And I looked over at him and I said \"What you eating there, boy, crayons?\" He said, \"Why no! They're Martian cigarettes! Here, try one!\"  Well, 'bout half hour later He looked over at me and smiled Them ol' Martians ain't got But two teeth in their head And he said, \"How do you feel?\"  And I said, \"Weeeeeeell, I feel so good Yeah, I do, gonna boogie Wow! Til the break of day!\"  Meanwhile, back at Eat's I was stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill thinking, I said \"How come out of all the places You could have landed You ended up here?\"  He said, \"Well, according To my lunar space map This town here is supposed to be The boogie capital of the U.S.A!\"  So I asked him, I said \"Now, where else you been, boy?\" And he told me  He said, \"I've rocked 'em over And I've rocked 'em down Rocked 'em in the country I've rocked 'em in town Rock 'n' roll, Memphis on up to Maine Woke up a lady and she asked my name! Told her the name was on ten of my shirts Told her, rocking chair Martian Don't have to work!\"  Yeah, I feel so good Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie Martian boogie  ",

It's a lie A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be But you know what truth is? It's that little baby you're holding And it's that man you fought with this morning The same one you're going to make love with tonight That's truth, that's love  Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children That might have made me complete But I, I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet  I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring That costs too much to be free, hey, lady I've been to paradise But I've never been to me  I've been to paradise Never been to me  I've been to Georgia and California And anywhere I could run I've been to paradise Never been to me  Been to Nice and the isle of Greece When I've sipped champange on a yacht I've been to paradise Never been to to me  ",
