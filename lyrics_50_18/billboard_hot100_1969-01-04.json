Waiter another round for the gang.\" It's strange how I always felt outta place Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face So I said \"See you later.\" 'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper So I pulled the revolver on my waist up Between the patrol car and the gray truck Behind the street lamp was a silouhette White gloves and a real long cigarette What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope She spoke, says, \"The devil got you guys by the throat Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence That's the reason why Eric B. is not president.\"  Well what do ya say  Ya see? Ya see? Ya see?  Look here see I know you got soul you're trying to hide it How did you kill a man out in Cypress One Eyed Charlie He only hangs with the criminal minded Says you guys did it doggy style is he lyin' She says, \"Walk this way, I'll tell you a children's story.\" We hit the bodega got her a few 40's We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy The truth came out as we got to her suave house Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch I said, \"It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight Who's ya sponsor lady?\" She says, \"Bill Gates.\" What are ya born 77 or 78? She says, \"Nah it goes way to an earlier date Slave times,\" claims the slaves said rhymes But she fell in love with some fella named Clive Who? \"Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx.\" Now she shows me the cash I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt She said Clive Campbell He's Kool Herc  Ah-ha! Ah-ha!  Listen up sweetheart Now we gettin somewhere As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died She said if you really love me I'll come back alive  ",
