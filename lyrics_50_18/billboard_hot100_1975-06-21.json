It goes in and comes out and starts over again  [Chorus] Wonderful baby Living on love The Sandman says maybe he'll take you above Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows Where babies float by just counting their toes  [Verse 2] Wonderful baby I'll watch while you grow If I knew the future You'd be first to know But I don't know nothing of what life's about Just as long as you live You'll never find out  [Verse 3] Wonderful baby Nothing to fear Love whom you will But doubt what you hear They'll whisper sweet things to make untrue So be good to yourself That's all you can do  [Chorus] You're a wonderful baby Living on love The Sandman says maybe he'll take you above Up where the girls fly on ribbons and bows Where babies float by just counting their toes Where babies float by just counting their toes  ",
