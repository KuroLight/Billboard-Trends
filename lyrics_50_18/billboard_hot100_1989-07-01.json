Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed At the boys from home, they all came running They were making noise, manhandling toys That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Yeah Timmy... Tell it like it is! Check out this DJ  [Verse 2:] So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile Committed a crime and went inside It was coming your way but you had to survive When you lost your babe, you lost the race Now you're looking at me to take her place  [Pre-Chorus]  Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch Looking good in a Buffalo Stance Looking good when it comes to the crunch Looking good's a state of mind State of mind don't look behind you State of mind or you'll be dead State of mind may I remind you Bomb the Bass...rock this place! What is he like? What's he like anway? Yo' man what do you expect the guy's a gigolo man You know I mean?

The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina I asked the guy, \"Why you so fly?\" he said, \"Funky Cold Medina\"  Funky Cold Medina  [Verse 2] This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina  You know what I'm sayin?

Break it down  [Verse 4] Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection I took a shot as a contestant on \"The Love Connection\" The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding I said, \"Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya\" That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina  Ya know what I'm sayin That Medina's a monster, y'all  Funky Cold Medina  ",
