She's so far gone she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're still the same old girl you used to be  [Chorus] You can't hide your lying eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes  ",
