I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright, I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am Oh, who am I?

What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know  [Bridge] So this is it? I sold my soul for this? Washed my hands of that for this? I miss my mom and dad for this? No When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are When I hear songs, they sound like a swan So come on Oh, come on Oh, come on Oh, come on  [Verse 2] Well, that is it, guys, that is all Five minutes in and I'm bored again Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks back home Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?  [Verse 3] My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called \"love\" And then I look into my nephew's eyes Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things That can come from some terrible nights  [Outro] The other night, you wouldn't believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up, but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance, oh  ",
