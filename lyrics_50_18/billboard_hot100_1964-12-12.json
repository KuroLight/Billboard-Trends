[Verse 2] Come on ev'rybody, I say now let's play a game  I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name  The first letter of the name  I treat it like it wasn't there  But a \"B\" or an \"F\" or an \"M\" will appear;  And then I say \"Bo\" add a \"B\" then I say the name  Then \"Bo-na-na fanna\" and \"fo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"\"f\" very plain  Then \"fee fi\" and a \"mo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"M\" this time  And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme    [Verse 3] Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold  Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold  Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!    [Verse 4] But if the first two letters are ever the same  Crop them both, then say the name  Like Bob, Bob, drop the \"B's\", Bo-ob  Or Fred, Fred, drop the \"F's\", Fo-red  Or Mary, Mary, drop the \"M's\", Mo-ary  That's the only rule that is contrary  And then I say \"Bo\" add a \"B\" then I say the name  Then \"Bo-na-na fanna\" and \"fo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"\"f\" very plain  Then \"fee fi\" and a \"mo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"M\" this time  And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme   [Verse 5] Say Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney  Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fo-ney  Fee fi mo-mo-ney, Tony!

Ran in the water heart full of fear there in the breakers I saw her near Reached for my darling held her to me stole her away from the angry sea I looked at the sea and it seemed to say you took your baby from me away My heart cried out she's mine to keep I saved my baby from that endless sleep Endless sleep endless sleep endless sleep  ",
