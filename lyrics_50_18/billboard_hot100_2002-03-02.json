Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones And pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue And the heroes who died just doing what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters?  [Chorus] I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  [Verse 2] Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day? Were you teaching a class full of innocent children Or driving down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages Or speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Or go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching And turn on \"I Love Lucy\" reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Did you stand in line and give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love?  [Chorus][x2] I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell You the difference in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us And the greatest is love  [Outro] And the greatest is love[x2] Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
