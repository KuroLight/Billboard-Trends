[Verse 1] I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp That right there could drive a sane man berserk Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to work How do you console my mom or give her light support Tellin' her her son's on life support? And just imagine how my girl feel On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man  [Hook] Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all Through the fire, through whatever, come what may For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way Right down to the wire, even through the fire  [Over Hook] I really apologize for everything right now If it's unclear at all, man They got my mouth wired shut For like\u2026 I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw I looked in the mirror And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man I couldn't believe it But I'm still here for y'all right now, man This what I got to say right here, dawg Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh  [Verse 2] What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal On the hottest rap label around?
