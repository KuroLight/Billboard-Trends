(Put them up, put  them up) (Put them up, put  them up) (Put them up, put  them up)  [Verse 1] It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend The one you let hit it and never called you again 'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins? You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again? Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin? Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem Baby girl, respect is just a minimum Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em Now, Lauryn is only human Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans Fake nails done by Koreans Come again  [Hook] Guys you know you'd better watch out Some girls, some girls are only about That thing, that thing, that thing That thing, that thing, that thing  [Verse 2] The second verse is dedicated to the men More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!) Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men Need to take care of they three or four kids And they face a court case when the child support late Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men The sneaky, silent men The punk, domestic violence men Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men How you gonna win when you ain't right within? How you gonna win when you ain't right within? How you gonna win when you ain't right within? Come again Come again Come again Come again  [Bridge] Watch out, watch out Look out, look out  [Bridge] Watch out, watch out Look out, look out  [Bridge] Watch out, watch out Look out, look out  [Bridge] Watch out, watch out Look out, look out  [Hook] Girls you know you'd better watch out Some guys, some guys are only about That thing, that thing, that thing That thing, that thing, that thing Guys you know you'd better watch out Cause some girls, some girls are only about That thing, that thing, that thing That thing, that thing, that thing  ",

Nobody's supposed to be here I tried that love thing for the last time My heart says \"No, no.\" Nobody's supposed to be here But you came along and changed my mind  [Verse 1] I've spent all my life on a search to find The love who'll stay for eternity The heaven sent to fulfill my needs But when I turn around, again, love has knocked me down My heart got broken, oh it hurts so bad I'm sad to say love wins again  [Pre-Chorus] So I placed my heart under lock and key To take some time to take care of me But I turn around and you're standing here  [Chorus]  [Verse 2] This time I swear I'm through But, if only you knew how many times I've said those words Then fall again, when will I ever learn? Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly Must take a chance, and spread my wings Love can make you do some crazy things  [Pre-Chorus & Chorus]  ",

Yesterday, you just smiled at me 'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry  [Outro] It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry It'll still be two days 'til we say \"Wasabi\" Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie  ",

Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close Remember good things come to those who want it most\" So I never left the house, without my rap book Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what? As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, \"Mack\"  [Chorus]  [Mack 10] Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me So call every publication, Billboard and the editor And tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_ I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef Cause now I get down with the North South and the East I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, \"Mack\"  [Chorus]  [Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch Money's just a touch away.. Money's just a touch, just a simple touch Money's just a touch away..  [Mack 10] Man I knew I was gonna make it, but they didn't believe me YaknowhatI'msayin?  Clowned me -- gon' be a rapper, what?

Dick] Chorus Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies  [Master P] We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy And every sunday grandma go to church She said she gotta pray for her baby And ah, your little son, he look just like you And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through And ah, me, C and Silkk, we got all the money but that don't mean shit Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain Keep your head up, and this for everybody That lost a relative in the street game  [Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick] Chorus  [Silkk The Shocker] Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you I just sit here wonderin why But the law of life, and god placed us here And said everybody must die Ain't it hard trying to move on, but still I try Even though we got money, judgement day Just some things we can't buy Even though you gone, I never let you move on Cause every time i think about you I sit back and write your name in a song Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt It's kinda spooky when I see your face on a t-shirt I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better And watch it, cause death or funerals bring our family together Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them You'll never know when they'll be here tommorow  [Sons of Funk/Mo B.

Did I have to lose control To treasure your kiss? Did I need to place my heart In the palm of your hand Before I could even start To understand?  [Chorus (Repeat Until Fade)] It's only when I lose myself with someone else That I find myself I find myself It's only when I lose myself with someone else That I find myself I find myself  ",
