I get to thinking lots of times About back when I was a lad Of the old home-place where I growed up; Of the days both good and bad  My overalls was hand-me-downs Y shoes was full of holes And I used to walk four miles to school every day Through the rain and the sleet and the cold  I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry For the things that his family would need But all he ever got was a bad-lands farm And seven hungry mouths to feed  And yet, and yet out home-fire never flickered once 'Cause when all these things went wrong Mama took the hymn-book down And mama sang a song  (What a friend we have in Jesus.)  I been rocked to sleep many a night To the tune of \"What A Friend\" TO THE TUNE OF \"WHAT A FRIEND\"; come morning \"Rock of Ages\" would waken me gentle once again  Then dad, he'd reach up and take the bible down And read it, read it loud and long I always thought that maybe our our home was blessed When daddy would say, \"Mamma, sing a song.\"  Sister left home first, I guess Then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan Then dad's hair was turnin' white 'N I had to be mama's little man  But it seemed that as daddy's back growed weak Mother's faith just growed strong And them were the greatest days of all When mama samg a song  (Rock of ages, cleft for me.) (Let me hide myself in thee.)... OOH, OOH, OOH. (Through Recitation)  I guess the house is still standing; I don't get back much no more No voice is left to fill them halls 'N no steps to grace the floor  You see, my mama sings in heaven now Around God's golden throne But I'll always believe this world Is a better place because, one time My mama sang a song  ",
