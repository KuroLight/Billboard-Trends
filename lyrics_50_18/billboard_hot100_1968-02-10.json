Oh not you again Say LeRoy, here's this woman with them skinny legs again She got a greasy mouth this time  Come over here and get this greasy mouth woman She reminds me of them folks up in Navisoda, Texas Eatin' barbecue and drinkin' red soda water on the 19th of June (laughter) Look here, give me a piece of that barbecue  And kiss me with your greasy mouth (laughter) I was talkin' to this woman the other day Now here's a woman that was gonna quit her man 'Cause he wasn't makin' enough money on his job  Talkin' 'bout how much tax Uncle Sam take out of his money She went on to say something like this She say they take tax and more tax and they keep on takin' that tax Why he take so much money from my man  We ain't got enough to relax Well let me tell you one thing baby You let that man stay on that ole measely job And let him keep bringin' home that little $72.50 every week  And you keep that man 'Cause Uncle Sam is gonna get his baby Don't you worry about that Men are gettin' scarce baby  They're gettin' scarce as hen's teeth You got some women their man ain't got no job Men droppin' off like flies  ",
