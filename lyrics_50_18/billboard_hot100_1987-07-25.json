[Verse 1] Aaaahhhhhhhhhh No rapper can rap quite like I can I'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand Not the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop Make you say \"Go LL,\" and do the wop If you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet Cause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet Trendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good I got a gold nameplate that says I wish you would And when rappers begin then I gotta join in and Before my rhyme is over, you know I'mma win Cool J has arrived so you better make way Ask anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play Slaughter competition, that's my hobby and job I don't wear a disguise because I don't owe the mob Got a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped So many girls on my jock, I think my phone is tapped I'm bad  Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J, Cool J  [Verse 2] I'm like Tyson, icin' I'm a soldier at war I'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more Got concrete rhymes, been rappin' for ten years and Even when I'm bragging, I'm bein' sincere! Emcees can't win I make 'em rust like tin They call me 'Jaws,' my hat is like a shark's fin Because I'm bad as can be, got my voice on wax Some brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed I couldn't, I shouldn't, and it'll stay that way The best rapper you've heard is LL Cool J Kamikaze take a look at what I've done Used to rock in my basement now I'm number one And can happen on time, never standin' on line You wanna try me? First you better learn how to rhyme I'm the pinnacle; that means I reign supreme And I'm notorious; I'll crush you like a jellybean! I'm bad  [?]  [Verse 3] I eliminate punks, cut 'em up in chunks You were souped, you heard me, and your ego shrunk I'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame Cause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane I'm as strong as a bull of course you know why I pull I enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full Not Buckaroo Banzai, but bustin' out as I Say the kind of rhymes that make MC's with that I'd die Never retire or put my mic on the shelf The baddest rapper in the history of rap itself Not bitter or mad, just provin' I'm bad You want a hit? Give me a hour plus a pen and a pad! MC's retreat, cause they know I can beat 'em And eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em I'm the baddest! Takin' out all rookies So forget Oreos, eat Cool J cookies, I'm bad!  Cool J, Cool J,Cool J,Cool J, Cool J,Cool J  [Verse 4] Never ever no never Never wearin' no Levis, battle me why try? I'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy \"bye bye\" Slaughterin' MC's and I'mma never get whipped When I retire I'll get worshipped like a old battleship LL I'm bad, all the rappers know When I enter the center they say, 'Yo, yo there he go!' My paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge Not a puncher or hunter from a raccoon lodge The original Todd, teachin' how to be hard Take the skin off a snake, and split a pea from a pod You're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue Not Attila the Hun, nor Abdullah his son My vocals exact, like rack and pinion in a Jag You try to brag, you get your rhymes from a grab-bag No good scavenger, catfish vulture My tongue's a chisel and this composition's sculpture, I'm bad!  [Outro] (Think I'm gonna need backup) (Think I'm gonna need backup)  Gimme that walkie-talkie! Yo this is LL Cool J And you'll never catch me so don't even try it Cause I'm too bad for ya, understand?! Aaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!  ",
