Shut up it was a hit and he became a star He got him some tight britches, got him a manager Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back And took up playin' the guitar And every Sunday afternoon You can go see Harry at the zoo And the girls will scream and he'll sit on his swing And pick and sing his hit record for you  Hoo hoo hoo Hoo hoo hoo Hoo hoo hoo ...

She stopped and I Knew Right away that it was gossip, not flowers, she had on her mind. And This is what I Heard my neighbor say-\"You know, that girl down the street should be run From our Midst. She drinks and she talks quite a lot. She knows not to speak to My child And me.\" My neighbor then smiled and I thought Oh, a tongue can accuse and carry bad news Gossip is cheap and it's lo-o-ow But unless you've made no mistakes in your life Be careful of stones that you throw SPOKEN: Just then a car speeded by in the screamin' of brakes-a sound That Made my blood chill. For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from The path And saved by a girl lyin' still. The child was unhurt and my neighbor Cried out \"Oh Who was that brave girl so sweet?\" I covered the crushed broken body And said \"The bad girl who lived down the street.\" So unless you've made no mistakes in your life Just be careful of stones that you throw  ",
