Is this cruel Or do we care?  Can they tell What's in our minds Maybe they've had secret loves All of the time  In the middle of making love We notice the time We both get nervous Cause it's way after 9:00  Even though we hate it We know it's time that we go We gotta be careful So that no one will know  Secret lovers, yeah That's what we are We shouldn't be together But we can't let it go  Cause what we feel Is, oh, so real So real, so real So real, so real  ",
