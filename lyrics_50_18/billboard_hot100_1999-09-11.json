Kelly] No matter what ya'll say or do We gotta get this money Watch out playa, we come for you Take all of your honies First of the month and rent is due We gotta get this paper Come for us, we'll wait for you A million men can't take us  [Hook: Tone] Did you ever think that you would be this rich Did you ever think that you would have these hits Did you ever think that you would be the don Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn Did you ever think that you would be this paid Were there times when your ass was real afraid Did you ever think that you would sell out tours Have a show with fifty million viewers  [Verse 1: R. Kelly] I used to think about how I was gonna make it Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper Hoping the day would come when things would go my way But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say  [Hook: Tone] Did you ever think that you would be this rich Did you ever think that you would have these hits Did you ever think that you would be the don Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn Did you ever think that you would be this paid Were there times when your ass was real afraid Did you ever think that you would sell out tours Have a show with fifty million viewers  [Verse 2: Nas] Hey yo Now who knows poverty like Robert and me Did you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me Did you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD With 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me Ain't naan nigga fly like me Honey you heard about the style I got We from the wildest blocks, where police Make arrests, carry heat wear vests, we ghetto Never thought we'd ever reach this level My people behind metal The streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish Our freaks be the baddest Bus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress It's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status Walk around and grown women stop and look They recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks Hate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck The remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook Come on  [Hook: Tone] Did you ever think that you would be this rich Did you ever think that you would have these hits Did you ever think that you would be the don Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn Did you ever think that you would be this paid Were there times when your ass was real afraid Did you ever think that you would sell out tours Have a show with fifty million viewers  [Bridge: Tone] America Did you ever think Ya ever know Did ya ever think Ya ever know (Come on) Did ya ever think Ya ever know Did ya ever think Ya ever know (Trackmasters)  [Hook: Tone] Did you ever think that you would be this rich Did you ever think that you would have these hits Did you ever think that you would be the don Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn Did you ever think that you would be this paid Were there times when your ass was real afraid Did you ever think that you would sell out tours Have a show with fifty million viewers  [Outro: R. Kelly] No matter what ya'll say or do We gotta get this money Watch out playa, we come for you Take all of your honies First of the month and rent is due We gotta get this paper Come for us, we'll wait for you A million men can't take us  [Hook: Tone] Did you ever think that you would be this rich Did you ever think that you would have these hits Did you ever think that you would be the don Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn Did you ever think that you would be this paid Were there times when your ass was real afraid Did you ever think that you would sell out tours Have a show with fifty million viewers  [Nas] I just wanna thank God For making Nas the don And R.
