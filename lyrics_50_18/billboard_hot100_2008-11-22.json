I'll walk  It was a dark night, a black dress Driver never saw her, around the bend I never will forget the call, or driving to the hospital When they said her legs still wouldn't move I cried, when I walked into her room  She said, I'll walk Please come and hold my hand Right now I'm hurt, and I don't understand Lets just be quiet, and later we can talk Please stay, don't worry. I'll walk  I held her hand through everything The weeks and months of therapy And I held her hand and asked her, to be my bride She's dreamed from a little girl, to have her daddy bring her down the aisle So from her wheelchair, she looks up to him and smiles  And says, I'll walk Please hold my hand I know that this will hurt, I know you understand Please daddy don't cry This is already hard Let's go, don't worry I'll walk  ",

Fuck it, I did wrong, you did wrong too You know what I'm saying? But we gotta put up with each others shit And the easiest thing to do is leave, you dig? Anyway, check this out...

I'm a hustla and I don't need them! One of them ya'll see! I'm so paid  [Verse 1: Akon] I see police on the crooked I Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95 My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die Wishing that motherfuckin' would, \u2018cause we're certified Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all It ain't too much to put a strain on me That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me I rather have them dollar bills rain on me Than let them haters come and make the name off me That's why  [Hook]  [Verse 2: Young Jezzy] She said, \"Young, why your voice so hoarse?\" I just sound like money, I should've been a Porsche (vroom) Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full And that's before the taxes Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress Used to get bored and count 20's for practice Paper therapy we let money relax us Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps I made a killing in the water, kill them in the water Against all odds and I will not stop They try and keep me on bottom, but I prefer the top And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc She said the house too small, I moved an extra block So, baby, get your ass up, I need an extra block I told her do the speed limit and no extra stops; and that's why  [Hook]  [Verse 3: Akon] I am the boss it only takes one call For a driver to hit you up and drop you off, that's all Guess what?
