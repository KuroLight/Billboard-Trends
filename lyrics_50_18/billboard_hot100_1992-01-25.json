There's a nigga tryin' to kill me I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window Investigatin' the joint for traps Checkin' my telephone for taps I'm starin' at the woman on the corner It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya  [Verse 2: Willie D] I make big money, I drive big cars Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star But late at night, somethin' ain't right I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights Is it that fool that I ran off the block?

I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here  [Chorus] No more tears [x4]  [Instrumental Break]  [Verse 3] So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye? I'd like to move on and make the most of the night Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here  [Chorus] No more tears [x4]  ",
