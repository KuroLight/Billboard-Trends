I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness, and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  [Verse 2] Let him know that you know best \u2018Cause after all, you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God he hears you And pray to God he hears you, and  [Chorus] Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness, and I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life  [Verse 3] As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones you've followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came  [Chorus] Where did I go wrong?

[Verse 2] Remember when we were such fools And so convinced and just too cool Oh no, no no I wish I could touch you again I wish I could still call you friend I'd give anything  [Chorus] When someone said count your blessings now 'Fore they're long gone I guess I just didn't know how I was all wrong They knew better, still you said forever And ever, who knew?  [Bridge] Yeah yeah I'll keep you locked in my head Until we meet again Until we, until we meet again And I won't forget you my friend What happened?  [Chorus] If someone said three years from now You'd be long gone I'd stand up and punch them out Cause they're all wrong  [Outro] That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember And I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep My darling, who knew? My darling, what happened? Who knew? My darling, I miss you What happened? Who knew?  ",
