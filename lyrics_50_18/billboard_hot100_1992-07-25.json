She's just so black!\"  [Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot] I like big butts and I cannot lie You other brothers can't deny That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist And a round thing in your face, you get sprung Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed Deep in the jeans she's wearin' I'm hooked and I can't stop starin' Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha And take your picture My homeboys tried to warn me But that butt you got makes (me so horny!) Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin You say you wanna get in my Benz? Well, use me, use me 'Cause you ain't that average groupie I've seen 'em dancin' To hell with romancin' She's wet, wet Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette I'm tired of magazines Sayin' flat butts are the thing Take the average black man and ask him that She gotta pack much back So, fellas!

[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot] \"Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3\".\"  [Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot] So your girlfriend rolls a Honda Playin' workout tapes by Fonda But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda My anaconda don't want none Unless you've got buns, hun You can do side bends or sit-ups But please don't lose that butt Some brothers wanna play that hard role And tell you that the butt ain't gold So they toss it and leave it And I pull up quick to retrieve it So Cosmo says you're fat Well I ain't down with that! 'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin' And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin' To the beanpole dames in the magazines: You ain't it, Miss Thing! Give me a sista, I can't resist her Red beans and rice didn't miss her Some knucklehead tried to diss 'Cause his girls are on my list He had game but he chose to hit 'em And I pull up quick to get wit 'em So ladies, if the butt is round And you want a triple X throwdown Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT And kick them nasty thoughts Baby got back!

(I reminisce, I reminisce) Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce) (I reminisce, I reminisce) (I reminisce, I reminisce)  [Verse 1: C.L. Smooth] I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track The birth of a child on the 8th of October A toast but my granddaddy came sober Countin' all the fingers and the toes Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh Eighteen years younger than my mama But I rarely got beatings cause the girl loved drama In single parenthood there I stood By the time she was 21, had another one This one's a girl, let's name her Pam Same father as the first but you don't give a damn Irresponsible, plain not thinking Papa said chill but the brother keep winking Still he won't down you or tear out your hide On your side while the baby maker slide But mama got wise to the game The youngest of five kids, hon here it is After 10 years without no spouse Momma's gettin married in the house Listen, positive over negative for the women and master Mother Queen's risin a chapter D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, tell you what I'm gonna do When they reminisce over you, my God  [Bridge 1: Pete Rock] My God It's so Yeah, so lovely That's how we like to do it in the 90's Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha  [Verse 2: C.L. Smooth] When I date back I recall a man off the family tree My right hand Poppa Doc I see Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father When my biological didn't bother Taking care of this so who am I to bicker Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver But you can never say that his life is through Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too Here we go while I check the scene With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14 The same age, front page, no fuss But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us Never been senile, that's where you're wrong But give the man a taste and he's gone Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over I said pop maybe when you're older We laughed all night about the hookers at the party My old man standing yelling good God, almighty Use your condom, take sips of the brew When they reminisce over you, for real  [Bridge 2: Pete Rock] For real, baby Like that We for real Comin' atcha In '92 Pete Rock & CL Smooth Yeah, c'mon, hit me!  [Verse 3: C.L. Smooth] I reminisce so you never forget this The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness Take the first letter out of each word in this joint Listen close as I prove my point T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet? In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street But only you saw what took many time to see I dedicate this to you for believing in me Rain or shine, yes in any weather My grandmom Pam holds the family together My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest I strive to be live cause I got no choice And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due When they reminisce over you, listen  [Outro: Pete Rock] Listen, just listen To the funky song as I rock on And that's word is bond I'm not playin Everybody, just coolin This song we dedicate To the one and only Never be another He was my brother Trouble T-Roy It's like that y'all And you don't stop Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92 And we out, later  ",

Damn, how could this happen?  Now St. Louis Yeah y'all, St. Louis  [Verse 3: DJ Quik] I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good They need to stop watchin that \"Colors\" and \"Boyz in the Hood\" Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw And never ever seen the Shaw But now, back to the story that I'm tellin We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits When I'm thinkin bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest And San Antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test And before it was over the shit got deep A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin' Little did they know that we was packin' Yeah, we was puttin' em down and scaring the rest, yo I even had to wear the bulletproof vest  Now San Antonio Yeah, San Antonio  [Verse 4: DJ Quik] After a month on the road We came home and I can safely say That L.A. is a much better place to stay How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this Have such a big influence on niggas so far away? But still my story ain't over cuz I got one more to tell And the people of Colorado, they know it well It was all in the news and if you don't remember I had this show I did in Denver With a punk ass promoter, in a bunk ass skatin rink Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my Guess When it was over two niggas needed stitches Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches  Now Denver Yeah, y'all Denver  I thought ya knew  ",
