Or has time re-written every line? If we had the chance to do it all again Tell me, would we? Could we?  Memories May be beautiful and yet What's too painful to remember We simply choose to forget So it's the laughter We will remember Whenever we remember The way we were  The way we were  ",

[Chorus:] Star Baby, flashy little shiny little two-timin' mama Star Baby, shiny little flashy little lovin' machine  [Verse 2:] I never been much good at keepin' a secret Now it's easy for me to say That I'm head over heels shook up About the way that you fool with me And if it please Your Highness on a sunny day sometime Can you take me ridin' babe, I'll tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout you  [Chorus]  [Verse 3:] Well I saw you last night on a Hollywood show And now it's easy for me to say That I'm head over heels shook up About the way that you sang to me And if it please Your Highness on a sunny day sometime Can you take me drivin' baby, kissin' in your Cadillac  [Chorus]  ",

Can you see the real me, doctor? Oh, doctor  [Verse 2] I went back to my mother I said, \"I'm crazy Ma help me\" She said, \"I know how it feels, son `Cause it runs in the family\"  Can you see the real me, mother, mother? Can you see the real me, mother? Oh, mama Can you see the real me? Can you see Can you see the real me? The real me, the real me  [Bridge] The cracks between the paving stones Like rivers of flowing veins Strange people who know me Peeping from behind every window pane The girl I used to love Lives in this yellow house Yesterday she passed me by She doesn't want to know me now  Can you see the real me, can you, can you? Can you see the real me, can you? Oh yes  [Verse 3] I ended up with the preacher Full of lies and hate I seemed to scare him a little So he showed me to the golden gate  Can you see the real me, preacher, preacher? Can you see the real me, preacher?  [Outro] Can you see, can you see, can you see Can you see the real me doctor Can you see the real me mother Can you see the real me me me me me...  ",
