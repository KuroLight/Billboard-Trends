Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing Bet my daddy can whip your daddy but daddy's never home And I think mommy's worried bout him cause she cried all night long  Kids say the darndest things... Have you ever listened close to the games they play or the little songs they sing You never know what they learn at school or what they're thinking of My first grader just said a four letter word and it sure wasn't love  Kids say the darndest things...
