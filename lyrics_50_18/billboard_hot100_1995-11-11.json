I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun Want to feel your warmth upon me I want to be the one  [Chorus] I will remember you, will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so tired but I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside oh we can't be heard  [Chorus] That I will remember you, will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  So afraid to love you But more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Where once there was a darkness Deep and endless night You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me life  [Chorus] And I will remember you, will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  And I will remember you, will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories  ",
