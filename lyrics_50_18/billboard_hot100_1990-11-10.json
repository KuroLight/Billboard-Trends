My love is a rock, an immovable force Anywhere that you are, my love is right here With any tick of the clock Life can change it's course But my love will not My love is a rock  You may not be looking for love, but love may find you You may choose to close your eyes and run You may leave love far behind you In your eyes I can see the future In your heart I can always trust In your mind I will live on forever In your arms I will turn to dust These are feelings like I have never known The song of my very soul I can no longer silently sing it I'm gonna take it to the mountain and let it roll singing.....  My love is a rock, an immovable force Anywhere that you are, my love is right here With any tick of the clock Life can change it's course Some things are here and then gone before you know Some things disappear without a chance to grow But my love will not My love is a rock  ",

But my loves still strong But i just can't keep holding on And holdin on and holdin on  ",

[Hook] Because I'm somewhere in between My love and my agony You see, I'm somewhere in between My life is falling to pieces Somebody put me together  [Verse 2] Layin' face down on the ground My fingers in my ears to block the sound My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight Droplets of \"yes\" and \"no\" In an ocean of \"maybe\" From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline From the top, another downhill slope of mine But I know, the equilibrium's there Indecision clouds my vision No one listens  [Hook]  ",

But it's gonna be right To get you into my life  In this crazy world I've been searching for the answer Then I saw you, girl I found out what my heart's been after  Could have been another day But if I looked the other way Then I couldn't have known What I've been missing all along  [Repeat Chorus:]  [Bridge:] With all that I know Still this Fill me with you  Girl, you know I got it going on But all I'm missing is you You, baby Oh, yeah All I'm missing is a-you  [Repeat Chorus:]  I need your loving Give me that love Gimme that loving  [Repeat Chorus:]  Wish you in my head Wish you in my bed, babe Wish you in my head Wish you in my bed, babe  ",
