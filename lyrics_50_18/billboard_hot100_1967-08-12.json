Said the clown Is it bringing you down That you've lost your chance?  Feeling low, gotta go See a show in town Hear the jokes, have a smoke And a laugh at the clown In a whirl, see a girl With a smile in her eyes Never thought I'd be brought Right down by her lies  In a trance, watch her dance To the beat of the drums Faster now, sweating brow I'm all the fingers and thumbs Wonder why I hit the sky When she blows me a kiss In a while run a mile I'm regretting all this  Chorus  Time to go, close the show Wave the people good-bye Grab my coat, grab my hat Look that girl in the eye Where's your home? What's your phone number? Stop fooling 'round Could have died, she replied \"I'm the wife of the clown.\"  Chorus  ",
