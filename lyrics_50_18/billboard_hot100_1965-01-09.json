Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold  Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold  Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!    [Verse 4] But if the first two letters are ever the same  Crop them both, then say the name  Like Bob, Bob, drop the \"B's\", Bo-ob  Or Fred, Fred, drop the \"F's\", Fo-red  Or Mary, Mary, drop the \"M's\", Mo-ary  That's the only rule that is contrary  And then I say \"Bo\" add a \"B\" then I say the name  Then \"Bo-na-na fanna\" and \"fo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"\"f\" very plain  Then \"fee fi\" and a \"mo\"  And then I say the name again with an \"M\" this time  And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme   [Verse 5] Say Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney  Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fo-ney  Fee fi mo-mo-ney, Tony!   [Verse 5] Let's do Billy!  Billy, Billy, bo-gil-ly, bo-na-na  Fanna, fo-fil-ly  Fee fi mo-mil-ly, Billy!    [Verse 6] Let's do Marsha!  Marsha, Marsha, bo-bar-sha  Bo-na-na fanna, fo-far-sha  Fee fi mo-ar-sha, Marsha!    [Outro] Little trick with Nick!  Nick, Nick, bo-bick, bo-na-na  Fanna fo fick, fee fi mo-mick. Nick!
