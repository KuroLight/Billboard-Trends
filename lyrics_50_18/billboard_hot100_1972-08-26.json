I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  [Bridge 1] It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?  [Classical guitar solo]  Alone again, naturally  [Verse 3] Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears  And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand, why the only man She had ever loved had been taken  Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken  And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally  ",

Let the man rap a plan Said he'd sing him home But his hope was a rope And he should've known It's hard to understand -- There was love in this man I'm sure all would agree That his misery was his -- Woman and things Now Freddie's dead -- That's what I said Everybody's misused him Ripped him up and abused him Another junkie plan Pushin' dope for the man A terrible blow But that's how it goes A \"Freddie\" 's on the corner now -- If you wanna be a junkie, wow! Remember: Freddie's dead! We're all built up with progress But sometimes I must confess -- We can deal with rockets and dreams But, reality -- what does it mean? Ain't nothing said 'Cause Freddie's dead! Hey, hey! Love, love! Hey, hey! Yeah, yeah! Ha, ha! Love, love! Yeah, yeah! Ha, ha! Yeah, yeah! Freddie's dead! All I want is some peace of mind With a little love I'm trying to find This could be such a beautiful world With a wonderful girl Why, I need a woman child! Don't wanna be like Freddie, now -- 'Cause Freddie's dead! Hey, hey! Yeah, yeah! If you don't try You're gonna die Why can't we brothers? Protect one another No one's serious And it makes me furious! Don't be misled -- Just think of Fred . .  Everybody's misused him Ripped him up and abused him Another junkie plan Pushin' dope for the man A \"Freddie\" 's on the corner now If you wanna be a junkie, why? Remember, Freddie's dead! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Freddies dead! Hey, hey! Ha, ha! Love, love! Ha, ha!  ",

        "lyrics": "  You gave your all and all to him, he was untrue He tried to find another girl sweeter than you Imagination sent him on a wild goose chase And now he sees no other girl can ever take your place  So now he's trying hard again to win you back But his heart is made of cellophane and you see through that When he held your love in the palms of his hands He wasn't satisfied, he charmed, and connived And he had to have another girl right there on his side  Oh, let's give a toast (Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast) To the fool (To the fool) Who let you go (Who let you go) Let's give a toast  (Give a toast, give a toast, here's another toast) To the fool (To the fool) Who let you (Who let you go) But now we're together he can't hurt you no more  Let's have another one, baby  Now when he held your love in the palms of his hands He wasn't satisfied, I said he charmed and connived And he had to have another girl right there on his side  Let's give a toast (Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast) To that fool (To the fool) Who let you go (Who let you go)  He can't hurt you no more (No, no, no) Three cheers (Three cheers, for the fool) For the fool (For the fool)  Who let you go (Who let you go) He can't hurt you no more (no, no,no) I tip my hat (Tip your hat) To the fool  (To the fool) To the fool Who let you go (Who let you go) He can't hurt you no more (No, no, no) Let's give a toast  Ain't it funny babe How can fate can work so strange? Sometimes to get to love You must go through so much pain Now, you gave your love so unselfishly And all that you got back in return was misery  I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad it all turned out this way You would never have left him Had he not drove you away But his lost was our every gain And the love that we share together now Is his every, every pain  Oh let's give a toast (Give a toast, give a toast, give a toast) To that fool (To the fool) Who let you go (Who let you go)  Let's give a toast (Give a toast, give a toast, here's another toast) To the fool (To the fool) Who let you go (Who let you go) But now we're together he can't hurt you no more  Let's give a toast, baby To that fool (To the fool) Who let you go (Who let you go)  Let's give a toast (Toast, yeah) To the fool (To the fool) Who let you go? (Who let you go?) But now we're together he can't hurt you no more  ",
