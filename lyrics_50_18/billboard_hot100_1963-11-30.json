I had him where I wanted him He was saying he'd be mine And none could take my place And I laughed in his face  Well, I made some goofs But this one tops them all So I think I'll go bang My head against the wall  Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head) I'm a stupid little girl Just a dumb head (dumb head) Do do do do...  I had him where I wanted him He was giving me his heart And begging me to stay And I just walked away  Well, gee, now I'm convinced That I must be insane Or else I was born with A peanut for a brain  Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head) I'm a stupid little girl Just a dumb head (dumb head) Do do do do...  I couldn't see the Forest through the trees The boy I loved was Down on his knees And I played the game And acted like a tease Somebody kick me, please  Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head) I'm a stupid little girl Just a dumb head (dumb head) Do do do do...  Now I'm convinced That I must be insane Or else I was born with A peanut for a brain  Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head) I'm a stupid little girl Just a dumb head (dumb head) Goofy little girl  Just a dumb head (dumb head) Silly little girl Just a dumb head (dumb head) Stupid little girl  Just a dumb head (dumb head) Stupid little girl...
