I have, it felt great It felt so good when I did it with my penis A girl let me do it, it literally just happened Having sex can make a nice man out the meanest Never guess where I just came from, I had sex If I had to describe the feeling, it was the best When I had the sex, man, my penis felt great And I called my parents right after I was done Oh, hey, didn't see you there, guess what I just did? Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest But sure nice of her to let you do that thing Nice of any girl ever! Now, sing  [Hook: Akon] I just had sex, and it felt so good (felt so good) A woman let me put my penis inside her Wanna tell the world  [Verse 2: Andy & Jorma] To be honest, I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it Doesn't really make sense! But, man, screw it I ain't one to argue with a good thing! She could be my wife That good? The best thirty seconds of my life I'm so humbled by a girl's ability to let me do her 'Cause honestly, I'd have sex with a pile of manure With that in mind, a soft, nice-smelling girl's better Plus, she let me wear my chain and my turtleneck sweater  [Bridge: Akon] So this one's dedicated to them girls That let us flop around on top of them, yeah Whether you're near or far, whether short or tall We wanna thank you all for letting us fuck you  [Interlude: Andy, Jorma, & Akon] She kept looking at her watch Doesn't matter, had sex But I cried the whole time Doesn't matter, had sex I think she might've been a racist Doesn't matter, had sex She put a bag on my head Still counts!  [Bridge: Akon] I just had sex, and my dreams came true (dreams came true) So if you've had sex in the last thirty minutes, then you qualified to sing with me  [Hook: Akon] I just had sex, and it felt so good (felt so good) A woman let me put my penis inside her I just had sex, and I'll never go back (never go back) To the not-having-sex ways of the past  ",
