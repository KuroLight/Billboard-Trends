He was willing to make a deal When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said \"Boy, let me tell you what.\"  \"I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.\"  The boy said, \"My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.\"  Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose the devil gets your soul  The Devil opened up his case and he said, \"I'll start this show.\" And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:  [Demonic violin piece]  When the Devil finished, Johnny said, \"Well, you're pretty good ol' son But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.\"  \"Fire on the Mountain.\" Run, boys, run! The Devil's in the house of the rising sun; Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no  [Non-demonic violin piece]  The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said, \"Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.\" And he played:  \"Fire on the Mountain.\" Run, boys, run!

She's the girl of my dreams!  Judy does what I ask her to She makes me happy when I feel blue She stares with the eyes of a child And gets me to my knees  Her heart, it never beats in time 'Cept when it's beating close to mine I keep her from my friends Locked away with my fantasies  And a man needs something When he ain't got nothing to hang onto And there ain't no telling When I feel like yelling, \"I love you\"  Ooooo It gets lonely in the night When there ain't no one around Ooooo She makes me feel alright Get my feet right off the ground  She's the girl of my dreams! She's the girl of my dreams! She's the girl of my dreams! She's the girl of my dreams! She's the girl of my dreams! She's the girl of my dreams!  ",

And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, find a way...  While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true...  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me  ",
