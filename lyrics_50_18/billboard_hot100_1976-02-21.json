I love to dance And I told him They don't take chances They seem so removed from romance They've been broken in churches & schools And molded to middle class circumstance And we were rollin' Rollin' Rock 'n' rollin'  Downtown The dance halls and cafes Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart Just doing the latest dance craze Gail and Louise In those push up brassieres Tight dresses and rhinestone rings Drinking up the band's beers Young love was kissing under bridges Kissing in cars Kissing in cafes And we were walking down Main Street Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays In France they kiss on Main Street Amour, mama, not cheap display And we were rollin' Rollin' Rock 'n' rollin'  Downtown In the pinball arcade With his head full of pool hall pitches And songs from the hit parade He'd be singing \"Bye, Bye, Love\" While he's racking up his free play Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys Come and carry us away Sometimes Chickie had the car Or Ron had a car Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head We'd all go looking for a party Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead And I'd be kissing in the back seat Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said And we'd be rollin' Rollin' Rock 'n' rolling  X2 Rollin' Rollin' Rock 'n' rollin'  ",
