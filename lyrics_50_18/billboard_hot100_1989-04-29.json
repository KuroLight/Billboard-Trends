The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina I asked the guy, \"Why you so fly?\" he said, \"Funky Cold Medina\"  Funky Cold Medina  [Verse 2] This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina  You know what I'm sayin? I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door I got Spuds McKenzie Alex from Stroh's They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal  [Verse 3] I went up to this girl, she said, \"Hi, my name is Sheena\" I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina She said, \"I'd like a drink,\" I said, \"Ehm - ok, I'll go get it\" Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina  You know, ain't no plans with a man This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?  Break it down  [Verse 4] Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection I took a shot as a contestant on \"The Love Connection\" The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding I said, \"Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya\" That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina  Ya know what I'm sayin That Medina's a monster, y'all  Funky Cold Medina  ",
