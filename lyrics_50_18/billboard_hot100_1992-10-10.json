He said, \"Hands in the air and hand over your keys\" Now we did And that was kinda simple Now, here came Margarita and her friend Shirley Temple I asked my friend 'bout Margarita He said that Shirley was a virgin and I wouldn't wanna meet her So I talked to Margarita, cause, yo, she was flyer I took her to the couch cause I wanted to screw-drive her Now I'm not one for a speech But there was plenty of Tequila and sex on the beach, y'all Tequila  {*Tequila theme playing*}  [A.L.T.] T-T-T-Tequila Yeah Alright Come on [All]    TEQUILA!  (Verse 2) Here we go again and I'm not fussin' See, I'm a French Mexican but I kick it with white Russians At the bar with the drink in my hand In walked Jose Cuevo, he was Margarita's man I talked to the Wise Man, cause yo, he's distinguished His name is St. Ides and he spoke in Olde English He said, \"You better think fast Cause Jose, is kind of crazy and I heard he shot glass\" He gave me some advice and it went like this, yo \"Catch the Nighttrain and head up to 'Cisco\" I didn't wanna stick around I caught the 151 to New York, the Greyhound Now I'm at the Red Zone, everybody stylin' Showbiz was sippin' Ice Teas on Long Island I blacked out, the party came to a halt Cause I was drinkin' the Tequila with the lemon and salt, y'all Tequila  {*Tequila theme playing*}  [A.L.T.] T-T-T-Tequila Yeah Alright [All]    TEQUILA!  (Verse 3) I woke up in the morning and felt like a zombie The Tequila Gold Label had bombed me You see I woke up late I wasn't feelin' so great And Mike said, \"There's a Bacardi party starting at eight\" Yo, we walked in the party and started playing our games We played tops, buds and quarters With Bartles & Jaymes Here came Shirley Temple and they told me to chill Because the Mickey Brothers took her up to Strawberry Hill They took her thousand dollar mink and she could barely think Cause the Tequila that she drank had her tickled pink Now, the music came on and I rocked the instrumental There's a groupie named Mai Tai, a fly oriental A groupie is a girl that jocks She wore a def Black Velvet, and drank Scotch on the rocks We had a Fake Marriage, now here's the Honeymoon Yo, it's on, Vagabond At the Blue Lagoon Now everybody take a couple of words from the wise A girlie and a bottle Tequila Sunrise Tequila  [ *horn section plays the 'Tequila' theme* ]  {*Tequila theme playing*}  [A.L.T.] Yeah Alright Come on [All]    TEQUILA!  {*Tequila theme playing*} {*people chattering and screaming \"TEQUILA!\"*}  ",

Hold the line Is this what's going on?  Where you going now? When your world's turned inside out Isn't love what it's all about? Where you going now? When you get to the top of the hill Gonna be there yes I will  There's a crack in the mirror There's a hole in the sun Full moon in the midnight sky And you feel like you wanna run So you blow out the candle And you turn off the light Then you stumble into darkness Do you believe that love is blind?  Didn't anybody tell you It's never too late to try? Hold the line Before you say goodbye  Where you going now? When your world's turned inside out Isn't love what it's all about? Where you going now? When you get to the top of the hill Gonna be there yes I will  Now I'm not talking 'bout what's good for me And I'm not saying, how you ought to be But if there is a message shining on through to you Take a little piece of mind And let your love light shine  Didn't anybody tell you It's never too late to try?
