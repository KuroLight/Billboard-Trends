Love was so good that it filled up all my needs  I was crazy for you You were crazy for me How could something so right go so wrong My love, sweet love  Why don't you say what you say When you say what you said anymore? Your eyes couldn't lie So long goodbye, close the door  I was crazy for you You were crazy for me How could something so right go so wrong My love, sweet love  Tell me something I didn't do Why did someone else have to pull you through? Did they steal you away like a thief in the night? Love like this must take flight  Why don't they play what they played On the nights you danced with me? Remember the one we made love to endlessly  I was crazy for you You were crazy for me And how could something so right go so wrong My love, sweet love  Why don't you do what you do When you did what you did to me? Do what you do when you did what you did to me Do what you do when you did what you did to me Do what you do when you did what you did to me  ",
