I remember the good times baby now, and the bad times too These last few weeks of holding on The days are dull, the nights are long Guess it's better to say Goodbye to you Goodbye to you Goodbye to you Goodbye to you 'Cause baby it's over now No need to talk about it It's not the same My love for you's just not the same And my heart, and my heart And my heart can't stand the strain And my love, and my love And my love won't stand the pain And my heart, and my heart And my heart can't stand the strain And my love, and my love And my love... Goodbye to you Goodbye to you Goodbye to you Goodbye to you How could I have loved someone like the one I see in you?
