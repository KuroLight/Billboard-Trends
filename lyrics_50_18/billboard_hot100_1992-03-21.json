Just when I thought our chance had passed You go and save the best for last  [Verse 2] All of the nights you came to me When some silly girl had set you free You wondered how you'd make it through I wondered what was wrong with you  Cause how could you give Your love to someone else And share your dreams with me  Sometimes the very thing You're looking for Is the one thing you can't see  [Chorus] But now we're standing face to face Isn't this world a crazy place?

And the address, so I can come visit?\" I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem 'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them 'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good! And if I didn't, some other girl would In my mind, I hope for the best Convincing myself that this was not a test 'Cause I heard many things about Georgie Nothing kinky, like no orgies I heard he knows how to make love Like an angel from the heaven above Who was I kidding I'd give him a try 'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin' 'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission  \"Can it be I've stayed away too long\" \"My world is empty without you, babe\" \"Can it be I've stayed away too long\" \"My world is empty...\"  [Verse 2] I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes \"She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised\" Good conversation over the phone He began to comfort me whenever I was alone George was sweet, so nice and so neat With any other guy he didn't have to compete George was mature, he made sure That he was the only man I'd ever adore Girls, have you, ever had a friend That you'd get with, every now and then? I know for a fact George had a lot of girls Spread out from state from state around the world As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me! But if I ever saw one, that would be the end He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry  \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\"  \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Can it be I've stayed away too long\" \"My world is empty without you, babe\" \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Kissed the girls and made them cry\" \"Can it be I've stayed away too long\" \"My world is...\" \"Kissed the girls and...\"  [Verse 3] George was clean, no drugs and such But once in a while, he'd drink too much Hangin' in a club where they play rockers Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka I was looking for him, and I found him there With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car I said, \"Don't drive, use your head Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead\" We begin to argue, bad words were said Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread Ran into the car as if, in a hurry He started the car but his vision was blurry He didn't care, he drove off into the night Riding for miles, without his headlights Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind He was still young yet running out of time Last week he took tests and the doctor told him George had cancer in his lungs and his colon See when he was twelve, he started smokin' Paid no attention when he started chokin' Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck 'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much How he made me feel with the slightest touch Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin' Wish he was here so I could say somethin' The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow Just to say no one is promised tomorrow If you love someone you should say it often You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin Wake up, it's important that you know that No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...

This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga We numb niggas, ya don't feel shit, nigga You ain't on no real shit, nigga  [Verse 1: B-Real] '91, Cypress Hill burst upon the scene Three crazy, gun-totin' niggas smokin' weed Talkin' about life on records was the whole plan So we put out The Phuncky Feel, but you were feeling Kill A Man That was about the time we was openin' up for royalties Didn't know shit, we were jus' tryin' to rock the party '92, a year later, 'bout a million records sold From doin' shows like Lollapalooza on the road Buildin' up momentum, whilst spittin' deadly venom Takin' pictures for High Times, me, Muggs, and Senen Chillin' with the Beastie Boys, smokin' lots of weed But it was time to hit the studio for another LP '93, Black Sunday hits, with critical acclaim Had a monster hit from Insane In The Brain Topped the charts, held the spot, for six weeks to boot It was a trip to note, that we was the first ones to do it In rap music, but it was a feat none the less So we started gettin paid and I stopped smokin' stress  [Hook: Kurupt and B-Real]  [Verse 2: B-Real] '94, still in the door and we conquered many tours With Rage Against The Machine, House Of Pain and many more Was even invited to Woodstock, some niggas from the block Called up Eric Bobo and half a million rocked How could all this happen at 24 years of age? Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage '95, I was alive and survived so far Still tryin' to cope with bein' a Rap Star 'Cos that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo With confusion, (I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (yeah) Even the record company, they became illusive When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution '96, with no support we were still makin' moves Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves But like every legend every clique, someone had to split So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'  [Hook: Kurupt and B-Real]  [B-Real] '97 was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2 Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms '98 was kinda great, cos it felt just like before We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall 'Cos it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again '99 I got to recline, because there was no doubt That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out '99 was even better than the year of '98 And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate 2000, 15 million records sold They broke the mould, but there's others along the road But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish 2001, goddamn, who knows what's in store? Just as long as motherfuckers know, who's knockin' on the door We remain unjaded and still we go unfaded See how long we made it and never ben outdated  [Bridge: B-Real (Sen Dog)] We ain't goin out, motherfucker (That's right, FUCK that!) You don't know, (it's big time Cypress Hill) (Motherfuckin' renovaters up here)  [Hook: Kurupt and B-Real]  [Outro - Kurupt] (It's the REEEEAAAAL!) Nigga, nigga Ni-ni-nigga [--(*scratched*) This the original Cypress Hill shit, nigga Nigga, nigga (*scratch*) nigga CYPRESS, nigga! Yeah!  ",
