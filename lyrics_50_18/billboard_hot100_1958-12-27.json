Are all the advertising people represented here?  CHORUS: Everyone except Amalgamated Cheese! SCROOGE: Well, if they're not here for the Christmas pitch, I can't help them find new ways of tying their product in to Christmas. That's why I'm chairman of this board! Let's hear it for me!  CHORUS: Hear, hear! SCROOGE: All right, Abercrombie, what are your people up to?  ABERCROMBIE: Ahhh, same thing as every year. Fifty thousand billboards showing Santa Claus pausing to refresh himself with our product  SCROOGE: Mmmmm, hmmm, well, I think the public has come to expect that and...  ABERCROMBIE: That's right. It's become tradition!  SCROOGE: You there, Crass, uhh, I suppose your company's running the usual magazine ads showing cartons of your cigarettes peeking out of the top of Santa's sack?  CRASS: Better than that! This year we have him smoking one  SCROOGE: Um-hmmm...  CRASS: Yes. We've got Santa a little more rugged, too. Both sleeves rolled up and a tattoo on each arm. One of 'em says \"Merry Christmas.\"  SCROOGE: What does the other one say?  CRASS: \"Less tar!\"  SCROOGE: Great stuff!  CRATCHET: But Mr.Scrooge...  SCROOGE: What? Who are you?  CRATCHET: Bob Cratchet, sir. I've got a little spice company over in East Orange, New Jersey. Do I have to tie my product in to Christmas?  SCROOGE: What do you mean?  CRATCHET: Well, I was just going to send cards out showing the three wise men following the Star of Bethlehem...  SCROOGE: I get it! And they're bearing your spices. Now that's perfect  CRATCHET: No, no... no product in it. I was just going to say, \"Peace on Earth... Good Will Toward Men.\"  MAN: Well, that's a peculiar slogan!  SCROOGE: Old hat, Cratchet! That went out with button shoes! You're a businessman... Christmas is something to take advantage of!  SCROOGE: A red and green bandwagon to jump on!  SCROOGE: A sentimental shot in the arm for sales! Listen!  CHORUS: Deck the halls with advertising Fa la la la la la la la la While you can be enterprising Fa la la la la la la la la On the fourth day of Christmas My true love gave to me Four bars of soap Three cans of peas Two breakfast foods And some toothpaste on a pear tree! On the fifth day of Christmas My true love gave to me...  SCROOGE: Five tube-less tires!  CHORUS: Fo-ur quarts of gin Three ci-gars Two cig-ar-ettes And some hair tonic on a pear tree! Chest-nuts roasting...  ANNOUNCER: Sayyyy, Mother, as sure as there's an X in Christmas, you can be sure those are Tiny Tim Chestnuts roasting. Tin-y Tim Chestnuts are frill-bodied... longer lasting! This visible shell protects the nut! Now with X-K 29 added, for people who can't roast after every meal  GIRL TRIO: Tin-ee Tim! Tin-ee Tim! Chest-nuts all the way!  ANNOUNCER: Tin-y Tim's roast hot... like a chestnut ought! And... they are (ECHO) mild, mild, mild, mild  CHORUS: Deck the halls with advertising Fa la la la la la la la la 'Tis the time for merchandising Fa la la la la la la la la Profit never needs a reason Fa la la la la la la la la Get the money, it's the season Fa la la la la la la la la  SCROOGE: Words to live by, Cratchet!  CRATCHET: For you, maybe. Can't you just wish someone merry Christmas, for the pure joy of doing it?  SCROOGE: Why? What's the percentage in that? Let me show you how to make Christmas work for you!  CHORUS: We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas We wish you a merry Christmas And please buy our beer!  SCROOGE: There you go, Cratchet! That's Christmas with a purpose  CRATCHET: I know, but wait a minute. Don't you guys make enough profit the other eleven months? Christmas comes but once a year  SCROOGE: Humph! Funny thing you should bring that up. That's exactly the point I was about to make. Hit it, boys!  SCROOGE: Christmas comes but once a year So you better make hay while the snow is falling That's opportunity calling you!  CHORUS: Rub your hands, December's here What a wonderful time to be Glad and merry!  SCROOGE: Just so you're mercenary too!  CHORUS: Buy an ad and show all the toys Show all the toys up on the shelf  SCROOGE: Just make sure that you get a plug You get a plug, In for yourself!  SCROOGE AND CHORUS: Christmas comes but once a year So you better cash in While the spirit lingers It's slipping through your fingers Boy! Don't you realize Christmas can be such a Monetary joy!  CRATCHET: Well, I guess you fellows will never change  SCROOGE: Why should we? Christmas has two s's in it, and they're both dollar signs  CRATCHET: Yeah, but they weren't there to begin with  SCROOGE: Eh?  CRATCHET: The people keep hoping you'll remember. But you never do  SCROOGE: Remember what?  CRATCHET: Whose birthday we're celebrating  SCROOGE: Well,... don't get me wrong. The story of Christmas, in it's simplicity, is a good thing - I'll buy that. It's just that we know a good thing when we see it  CRATCHET: But don't you realize Christmas has a significance, a meaning  SCROOGE: A sales curve! Wake up, Cratchet, it's later than you think  CRATCHET: I know, Mr. Scrooge, I know  CHORUS: On the first day of Christmas The advertising's there, with Newspaper ads Billboards too Business Christmas cards And commercials on a pear tree... Jingles here, jingles there Jingles all the way Dashing through the snow In a fifty-foot coup-e O'er the fields we go Selling all the way...

Why it's Little Red Ridin' Hood Hey there Little Red Riding Hood You sure are lookin' good You're everything a big bad wolf could want Listen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood I don't think little big girls should Go walkin' in these spooky old woods alone  What big eyes you have The kind of eyes that drive wolves mad So, just to see that you don't get chased I think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways  What full lips you have They're sure to lure, someone bad So, untill you get to grandma's place I think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe  I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on Till I'm sure that you've been shown That I can be trusted walkin' with you alone  Little Red Ridin' Hood I'd like to hold you if I could But you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't  What a big heart I have The better to love you with Little Red Ridin' Hood Even bad wolves can be good I'll try to keep satisfied Just to walk close by your side Maybe you'll see things my way Before we get to grandma's place  Little Red Ridin' Hood You sure are lookin' good You're everything a big bad wolf could want  I mean...
