Woo!  [Verse 1] If you don't like The world you're living in Take a look around At least you got friends You see I called my old lady For a friendly word She picked up the phone Dropped it on the floor (Ah-s ah-s) is all I heard  [Pre-Chorus] Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down? Oh, no lets go!  [Chorus] Let's go crazy Let's get nuts Let's look for the purple banana Until they put us in the truck, let's go!  [Verse 2] We're all excited But we don't know why Maybe it's cause We're all gonna die And when we do (when we do) What's it all for (what's it all for) You better live now Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door  [Pre-Chorus] Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down? Oh, no let's go!  [Chorus] Let's go crazy Let's get nuts Look for the purple banana Until they put us in the truck, let's go!  [Ad lib / Instrumental break] C'mon baby Let's get nuts! Yeah (Crazy) Let's go crazy!  [Pre-Chorus] Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down? Oh, no let's go! Go (Go crazy)  [Bridge] I said let's go crazy (go crazy) Let's go (Let's go!) Go (Let's go!)  [Verse 3] Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright Will make everything go wrong Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill Hang tough children  He's coming He's coming Coming  [Guitar solo]  [Outro] Take me away!
