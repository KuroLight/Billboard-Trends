Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of taking off my shirt  [Verse 3] It's been one week since you looked at me Threw your arms in the air and said, \"You're crazy\" Five days since you tackled me I've still got the rug burns on both my knees It's been three days since the afternoon You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon Yesterday, you'd forgiven me And now I sit back and wait til you say you're sorry  [Verse 4: Ed Robertson] Chickity China, the Chinese chicken You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin' Watching X-Files with no lights on We're dans la maison I hope the Smoking Man's in this one Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic Like Sting, I'm tantric Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy Like Kurasawa, I make mad films, okay, I don't make films But if I did they'd have a Samurai Gonna get a set of better clubs Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon 'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes That make me think the wrong thing  [Chorus] How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad? Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of losing my shirt  [Verse 5] It's been one week since you looked at me Dropped your arms to your sides and said, \"I'm sorry\" Five days since I laughed at you and said \"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do\" Three days since the living room We realized we're both to blame but what could we do? Yesterday, you just smiled at me 'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry  [Outro] It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry It'll still be two days 'til we say \"Wasabi\" Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie  ",

Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak Around the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress You all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress All day, every day, every which way Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!) This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this  [Bridge] Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers Willies, thugs, ballers, busters Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving  [Hook] What you see is what you get now The kinda style make the whole world go wild Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit  [Verse 2] You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black Take your breath like an asthma attack Just a slave like Flavor Flav, \"You're blind to the facts\" Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?) A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree Roundhouse to the mouth right And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it  [Hook]  [Verse 3] The year everybody start to rush Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt Get cut from the belly up (What?) I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things Material things, protected by the underground kings Who rule the land with an iron fist The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry) You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose Colossal! True, original b-boy apostle Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo  [Verse 4: Talib Kweli] You think you the shit? Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit It could be your crew or clique Or some random kid you smoked buddha with Consider me the entity within the industry without a history Of spitting the epitome of stupidity Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be done properly My name is in the middle of equality People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano  [Verse 5: Mos Def] Still sipping wishing well water, imported from Pluto Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot precede us In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs Our cypher will complete us as we come through your receivers You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us (Line for line) Good Jesus!
