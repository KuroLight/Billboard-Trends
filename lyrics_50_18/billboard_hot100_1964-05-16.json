Or did I just dream I saw heaven Shining in your eyes? If you knew how much I love you, yes I do Oh, my darling, your heart would bow Mmm, yes, you'd know, you'd know why I have said \"It's too late to turn back now\" (Too late to turn back now) Yes, I love you (Too late to turn back now) And do not necessarily correspond with lyrics from other recordings, sheet Music, songbooks or lyrics printed on album jackets  ",
