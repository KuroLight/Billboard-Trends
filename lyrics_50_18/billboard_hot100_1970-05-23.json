The old man would carve toys for the little girl, and she would draw pictures for him of beautiful ladies surrounded by green trees and sunshine, and they laughed alot. But then on the first day of June, the little girl ran to the fence to show the man a picture she had drawn, BUT HE WASN'T THERE! And somehow, the little girl knew he wasn't coming back. So she went back to her little room, took out a crayola and a piece of paper, and wrote:  \"Whoever finds this, I love you!\" \"Whoever finds this, I need you!\" \"I don't even have no one to talk to.\" \"So, whoever finds this, I love you!\"  ",

Somehow our love Has been misled By a lot of things That the other men said  But I love you, oh yes, I do For what you are I love you, I love you I love you, I love For what you're made of  Ain't that loving you? Ain't that loving you For more reasons than one?  Has it ever occurred to you Why I do all that I can do? Just to keep a little smile Upon your face  It's because I love you I love you, baby In so many times  Somehow, our love Has been misled By a lot of things That the other men said  But I love you, oh yes, I do For what you are Even love you, I love you I love you, I love you For that you made me become  Ain't that loving you? Ain't that loving you For more reasons than one?  Oh baby, I love the way You kiss my lips Oh baby, I love the way You swivel your hips  Oh baby, I love the way That you understand Oh baby, I love the way  ",

Am I going crazy Or is this just a dream? Now wait a minute - I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere So it's all in my head And then I heard her say ...one more time:  Spill the wine take that pearl  I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared But soon she returned In her hand was a bottle of wine In the other, a glass She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And just before she drunk it She said:  Take the wine, take that pearl Spill the wine, take that pearl  ",
