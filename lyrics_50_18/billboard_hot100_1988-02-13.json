All my life It`s always been my shadow and me  Over my shoulder There`s always a voice Somewhere saying I never should try to set my heart free  I wish that love would come And take me in her arms And show me what I've never known  Where I could hold someone And words like right and wrong Just fade away like yesterday  [Chorus:] Lonely won't leave me alone Lonely won't leave me alone Why? Tell me why? Won`t even let me fall in love  Ooh Everywhere I go Always by my side Won't even let me fall in love  [Verse 2:] I try and say I love you But the words won't come through When my eyes see all the tears And sad memories  Why can't I start out new And leave that old feeling too? Far behind I guess that lonely needs company  Around each bend of road I`m thinking back in time There will be that rainbow's end  But when I follow love Self delusions I find That it's only lonely and me again  [Repeat Chorus x2:]  ",
