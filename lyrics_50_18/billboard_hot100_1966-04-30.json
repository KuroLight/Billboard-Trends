And so he hid Inside a doggie from madrid He arrived in the city Still singin his sweet harmony As proud as any flea could be  He walked around As if he owned the town Humming his pint sized melody With his guitar he knew he'd be a star And in his own home town, how proud he'd be  Then all at once he met a man Who said, \"I'll help you if i can\" He listened close to his song And then he sang right along for you see He loved that little spanish flea  ",
