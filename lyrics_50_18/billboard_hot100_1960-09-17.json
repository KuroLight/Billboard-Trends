We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension, man, what a ride I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln\"  ",

I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots\"  Smoke was rollin' out in the back When I started gainin' on that Cadillac I knew I could catch him, and hoped I could pass But when I did, I'd be short on gas  Went around a corner with the tires in the side You could feel the tension, man what a ride I said, \"Hold on, I've got a license to fly\" And a Cadillac pulled over and let me by  And all of a sudden a rod started knockin' When down in the dips, and she started to rockin' I look in my mirror, and a red light was blinkin' Cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln  Well they arrested me and put me in jail And called my pop to throw my bail He said, \"Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin' You don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln!\"  ",
