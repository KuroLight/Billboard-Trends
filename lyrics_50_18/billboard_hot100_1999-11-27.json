With the top let back and the sunshine shinin' Cowboy, baby! West Coast chillin' with the Boone's wine I want to be a Cowboy, baby! Ride at night cause I sleep all day! Cowboy, baby! I can smell a pig from a mile away  [Verse 2] I bet you'll hear my whistle blowin when my train rolls in It goes (whistling), like dust in the wind Stoned pimp, stoned freak, stoned out of my mind I once was lost but now I'm just blind Palm trees and weeds, scabbed knees and rice Get a map to the stars, find Heidi Fleiss And if the price is right then I'm gonna make my bid boy And let Cali-for-ni-a know why they call me  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] Yeah! Kid Rock you can call me Tex Rollin' Sunset woman with a bottle of Beck's Seen a slimmy in a 'Vette, rolled down my glass And said \"Yeah this dick fits right in your ass\" No kiddin', gun slingin', spurs hittin' the floor Call me hoss, I'm the boss with the sauce and the whores No remorse for the sheriff, in his eye I ain't right I'ma paint his town red then paint his wife white Cause chaos rock like Amedeus Find West Coast pussy for my Detroit playas Mack like mayors ball like Lakers They told us to leave but bet they can't make us Why they wanna pick on me Lock me up and snort away my key I ain't no G, I'm just a regular failure I ain't straight outta Compton, I'm straight out the trailer Cuss like a sailor, drink like a mick My only words of wisdom are just suck my dick I'm flickin' my Bic up and down that coast and Keep on truckin' till I fall in the ocean  [Chorus]  ",
