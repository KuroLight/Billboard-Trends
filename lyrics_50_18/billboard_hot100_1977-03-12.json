Oh, I don't know why she's leaving Or where she's gonna go I guess she's got her reasons But I just don't want to know 'Cos for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice  Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice...  {Who the fuck is Alice?}  Grew up together Two kids in the park Carved our initials Deep in the bark Me and Alice Now she walks through the door With her head held high Just for a moment, I caught her eye As a big limousine pulled slowly Out of Alice's drive  Oh, I don't know why she's leaving Or where she's gonna go I guess she's got her reasons But I just don't want to know 'Cos for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice  Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance Now I gotta get used to not living next door to Alice...  Sally called back, asked how I felt She said: \"I know how to help - Get over Alice\" She said: \"Now Alice is gone But I'm still here You know I've been waiting For twenty-four years...\" And the big limousine disappeared...  I don't know why she's leaving Or where she's gonna go I guess she's got her reasons But I just don't want to know 'Cos for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice  Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance To tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice...
