Knowing these tears I cry, this lovely black butterfly Must take a chance, and spread my wings Love can make you do some crazy things  [Pre-Chorus & Chorus]  ",

You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again? Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin? Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem Baby girl, respect is just a minimum Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em Now, Lauryn is only human Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans Fake nails done by Koreans Come again  [Hook] Guys you know you'd better watch out Some girls, some girls are only about That thing, that thing, that thing That thing, that thing, that thing  [Verse 2] The second verse is dedicated to the men More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!) Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men Need to take care of they three or four kids And they face a court case when the child support late Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men The sneaky, silent men The punk, domestic violence men Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

One less hungry mouth on the welfare!\" First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other \"It's time to fight back,\" that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?

It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back \u2018Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years \"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,\" that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Outro: 2Pac] Some things'll never change  ",
