Oh, where's it gone?  Two floors above the butcher First door on the right And life filled to the brim As I stood by my window And looked out on those Brooklyn Roads  I can still recall The smells of cookin' in the hallways Rubbers drying in the doorways And report cards I was always Afraid to show  Mama'd come to school And as I sit there softly crying Teacher'd say, \"He's just not trying Got a good head if he'd apply it But you know yourself It's always somewhere else.\"  I built me a castle With dragons and kings And I'd ride off with them As I stood by my window And looked out on those Brooklyn roads  Thought of going back But all I'd see are stranger's faces And all the scars that love erases But as my mind walks through those places I'm wonderin' What's come of them?  Does some other young boy Come home to my room Does he dream what I did As he stands by my window And looks out on those Brooklyn roads Brooklyn roads  ",
