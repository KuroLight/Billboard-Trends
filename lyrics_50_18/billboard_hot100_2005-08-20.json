[Verse 1] Little Jimmy Jackson is jacking up his Bronco He is going to lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull And all the girls are getting pretty. They are spraying on the White Rain Yeah, they are going to get a rowdy tonight down at the football game  [Hook] Yeah, we let it rip when we got the money Let it roll if we got the gas It gets wild, yeah, but that is the way we get down In a Hick town  [Verse 2] Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles And his woman smoking Pall Mall is watching Laura Ingalls And Granny is getting lit, she is heading out to bingo Yeah, my buddies And me are going mudding down on Blue Hole Road  [Hook]  [Instrumental Break] (Oh, stand on it.)  [Verse 3] We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio  [Hook] [x2]  [Outro] Got your country boys and your redneck girls It is the party heard round the world Right here in Hicktown In Hicktown The whole town is getting down In Hicktown Yeah, in Hicktown  ",
