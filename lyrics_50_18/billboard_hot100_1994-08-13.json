I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer I'm not one for playing high-pole Like the high soditty 90210 type of the ho I treat a man like he treats me The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me Now you can get with that or you can get with this But I don't give a shit cause really it's none of your business  1993, S-N-P, packing and macking Bamboozling and smacking suckers with this track Throw the beat back in!  If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight It's none of your business And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend It's none of your business Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to It's none of your business So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time It's none of your business  How many rules am I to break before you understand That your double-standards don't mean shit to me? I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away But that's OK cause I don't let it get it to me Now every move I make somebody's clocking Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone? Never mind who's the guy that I took home...to bone  OK, Miss Thing never giving up skins If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz? Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step Or better yet get your head checked Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars You can call me a tramp if you want to But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you Or you can front if you have to But everybody gets horny just like you So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business  If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight It's none of your business And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend It's none of your business Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to It's none of your business So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time It's none of your business  So the moral of this story is: Who are you to judge? There's only one true judge, and that's God So chill, and let my Father do His job  Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again (repeat to fade)  ",

I cry As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die Visions of Hell tormented my faith So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape  [Break: Judge (jury)] (Your arm?!
