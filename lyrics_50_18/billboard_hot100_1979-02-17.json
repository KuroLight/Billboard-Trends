The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing  ",

He'll leave nothing but only to hear him I've seen the tall trees bend low when his mighty winds blow And that's all the more reason I fear him Hear him call for the earth lonely I can feel his great pain But on the eve of this day I'll join in his refrain  When I'm needing a friend I'll remember the wind And my life here with the breezes of sorrow I'll be leaving him soon 'cause I've got to make room For the lonely that will find him tomorrow On a black stormy night in your bosom I'll cling And I'll know I've found love and the last song we'll sing  ",
