With no Tom Hanks to bring you home A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone  [Pre-Hook: Guy Sebastian] I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched I wish that I could stop loving you so much Cause I\u2019m the only one that's trying to keep us together When all of the signs say that I should forget her I wish you weren\u2019t the best, the best I ever had I wish that the good outweighed the bad Cause it\u2019ll never be over, until you tell me it's over  [Hook: Guy Sebastian] These battle scars, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re fading Don\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going away They ain't never gonna change These battle scars, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re fading Don\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going away They ain't never gonna change These battle  [Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco] (And just leave then) You shouldn't have but you said it (And I hope you never come back) It shouldn't have happened but you let it Now you're down on the ground screaming medic The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses Shields, body armors and vests Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt The enemy within and all the fires from your friends The best medicine is to probably just let her win  [Pre-Hook 2: Guy Sebastian] I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much Cause I\u2019m the only one that's trying to keep us together When all of the signs say that I should forget her I wish you weren\u2019t the best, the best I ever had I wish that the good outweighed the bad Cause it\u2019ll never be over, until you tell me it's over  [Hook: Guy Sebastian] These battle scars, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re fading Don\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going away They ain't never gonna change These battle scars, don\u2019t look like they\u2019re fading Don\u2019t look like they\u2019re ever going away They ain't never gonna change These battle  [Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco] Cause you've set me on fire I\u2019ve never felt so alive, yeah No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does That's because you're at war with love And I\u2019m at the point of breaking And it\u2019s impossible to shake it  [Pre-Hook: Lupe Fiasco] See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does That's cause you're at war with love Hope it heals, but it never does That's cause you're at war with love!
