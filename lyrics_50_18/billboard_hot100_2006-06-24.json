Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  [Bridge] What's the hook, the twist Within this verbose mystery? I would gladly bet my life upon it That the ghost you love, your ray of light Will fizzle out without hope We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin Ever searching for what we were promised Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?  [Chorus] Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  [Video]  ",

Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change (Every time I hear your name.) In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head  I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes That's all it takes, an' I'm in that place An' there we are, a point down by the riverside An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place Every time I hear your name Every time I hear your name (Every time I hear your name.) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Every time I hear your name.) Ah ah Every time I hear your name  ",
