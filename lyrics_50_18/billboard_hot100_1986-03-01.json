Yeah, just look at them (Woof)  The dog is coming out of them A natural dog Radar (Woof) Radar, kitty girl  I think I'm gonna leave right now Because I have some things to do Call my chauffeur I love you I love you all, but I got to go  Oh, turn me on The men all pause The men all pause The men all pause The men all pause  [Repeat Chorus:]  ",
