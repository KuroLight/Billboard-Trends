How you gonna keep from turning your life away?  No days you can borrow, no time you can buy No trust in tomorrow. It's a lie And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin' My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin' But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels My world is a constant confusion My mind is prepared to attack My past a persuasive illusion I'm watchin' the future it's black What do you know? You know just what you perceive What can you show? Nothing of what you believe And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds And you wound yourself and your loved one bleed And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds On all that you thought you should be I never thought this could happen to me  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down Round and around the world you go Spinning through the lives of the people you know We all slow down How you gonna keep on turning from day to day?
