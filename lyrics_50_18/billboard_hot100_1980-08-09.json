You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.\"  [Chorus 1] Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the car I'm driving? \"Can't you tell that it's out of style?\" Should I get a set of white wall tires? \"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile? Nowadays you can't be too sentimental Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.\"  Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk It's still rock and roll to me  Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers Cause it's always been the same old scene There's a new band in town But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine... Aimed at your average teen  How about a pair of pink sidewinders And a bright orange pair of pants? \"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby If you just give it half a chance Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey?

When you're walking down the street Show your feminine appeal Even tho' you're wearing jeans It's important to be real You were born to be yourself So no matter how you feel If you want to impress the opposite sex When he takes you for a ride Let him open you the door When he asks you for a dance Let him lead you to the floor When he kisses you good night You just leave him wanting more You can do all you can Say I am what I am But first be a woman... oh oh oh oh When he takes you out to dine Don't you end up in his bed Wedding bells will ring in time Make him dream of you instead And his passion can be like All the stories that you've read He can be Romeo if you act like Juliet Nowadays it ends too soon Even tho' it's just begun You can take him to the moon He'll leave with the morning sun So take a lesson from the past Make him want and make him run... (You can't be a quarterback He can't wear a pretty dress You cannot be Superman And he's not a shy princess So why try to be alike When it's only self defense ? You've got grace, he's got style And together you'll rhyme So remember to be true To the legend that you are All the feminine in you Has worked miracles so far So head up high and don't be shy You can reach for any star You can do all you can... Say I am what I am You can be an executive Hhh ! You can drive a train You can be a detective...  ",

He may be a psychopath, he's acting so strange Lying to himself, saying nothing has changed He stares across at a house on the block Trying to find the courage to go over and knock What will he say when they open the door? \"This was my home, but it ain't no more.\"  He can't get Brixton, out of his system It seems so pathetic, yeah, but it's hard to forget it  Way back in '59, a young boy was crying, he didn't want to leave, but what could he say? Jumped into the lorry, left there in a hurry, never knowing he'd back some day  Stranger in my home town, I'm just a stranger in my home town Could this street be a part of me? I can't believe it - this ain't no place to be  Who's that Peeping Tom climbing the wall? Staring at the back yard, he's gonna fall He looks so suspicious, I should called the law I wish I could remember where I've seen him before  Sunrise to sundown, stumbling through London town He acts like he's stranded, but that's how he planned it  Way back in '59, a young boy was crying, he didn't want to leave, but what could he say?
