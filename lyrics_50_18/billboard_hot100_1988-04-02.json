Who's right? Another fight and I slam the door on Another battle in our dirty little war When I look at myself I don't see The man I wanted to be Somewhere along the line I slipped off track I'm caught movin' one step up and two steps back  [Verse 4] There's a girl across the bar I get the message she's sendin' Mmm she ain't lookin' too married And me, well, honey I'm pretending Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms The music was never-ending We danced as the evening sky faded to black One step up and two steps back One step up and two steps back One step up and two steps back  Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh  ",

Everyone used to run them down They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight, not enough tough for this town Couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole, no, it didn't seem to rattle at all They were glued together body and soul, that much more with their backs up against the wall Oh, hold them up, hold them up, never do let them fall Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin that names us and claims us and shames us all I guess it had to happen someday soon- wasn't nothing to hold them down They would rise from among us like a big balloon, take the sky, forsake the ground Oh, yes, other hearts were broken, yeah, other dreams ran dry But our golden ones sail on, sail on to another land beneath another sky (Let other hearts be broken, let other dreams run dry) But our golden ones sail on, sail on to another land beneath another sky, beneath another sky  [Outro] Hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up (Hold them up, don't let them fall)  ",
