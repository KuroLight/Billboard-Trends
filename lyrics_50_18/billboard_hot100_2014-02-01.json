I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music \"Oh, he's too mainstream.\" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it \"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\" \u2013 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it \"I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use.\" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to? Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you! I'm drunk \u2013 so, Satan, take the fucking wheel I'ma sleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard \u2013 be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God?  ",

There ain't no \"I\" in team You make me complete You're all that matters to me  [Verse 2] Take the gas out the car, it won't drive That's how I feel when you're not by my side When I wake up in the morning up under you And only you Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence Faithful no matter the distance You're the only girl I see From the bottom of my heart, please believe  [Chorus] You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah Ain't worried about nobody else If I ain't with you, I ain't myself You make me complete You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah What's a king bed without a queen? There ain't no \"I\" in team You make me complete You're all that matters to me  [Outro] Yeah yeah, yeah yeah You're all that matters to me Yeah yeah, yeah yeah You're all that matters to me  ",
