Which is camel for, \"What the heck did he say anyway?\" Well....  He brought that camel to a screeching halt At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes And a bone in her nose ho, ho Spoken  There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby.\" (laughter) You know what I mean! Whew!
