Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way The girls in the bars thinking, \"who is this guy?\" But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies You look so careless when they're shooting that bull Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full  [Chorus] Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache See what else your old heart can take The boys say, \"when is he gonna give us some room\" The girls say, \"God I hope he comes back soon\"  [Verse 2] Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing You're still uptown on your downhill swing Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around? Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown? Splitting your dice to be someone you're not You say you're looking for something you might've forgot Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home  [Chorus X2]  ",
