I've always felt the rhythm What happens when there's no more rhyme?  [Verse 2:] Can we face ourselves Like we face each other? We've never felt anything On our own I can't wait much longer To feel any danger I hope we're not living For a lifetime alone  [Chorus:] I know we are right It's not always clear Because I've never felt the fear Can it stay so good forever in time? I've always felt the rhythm What happens when there's no more rhyme?

I got the suit and a pink guitar Oh daddy, when you gonna break it wide open I don't know but I still keep hopin' Oh daddy, are you gonna make a million bucks? All it takes it a whole lotta luck, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh daddy, when you gonna have that fat Cadillac like you always said? Oh daddy, when you gonna put on some stretch pants, yeah?
