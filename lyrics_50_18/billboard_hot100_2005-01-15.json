Gerald Just this morning I took a stroll through your garden I watched the sunrise and it made me think of you The way you talk to the flowers and make them grow And in the middle of all these flowers There's one single stem red rose It stood out from the rest the fairest of them all It made me think of what you asked me Can you call a rose by any other name?  Lady your body moves like poetry Like a diamond in the raw You shine for me No one else can hold her hand up to you girl Cause you're everything I need in my world lady  Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain Can you call a rose by any other name Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged Can you call a rose by any other name?  Gerald Take your time  Teena In there, I got a song for you boy Telling the world about the joy inside my garden  In the shade baby Cause my world was spinning round Until you made my love come down never gonna let you go No, I never gonna let you go  Lately all the flowers seem to be so plain Can you call a rose by any other name Here inside your garden it's like I feel unchanged Can you call a rose by any other name?  Anything you want  Anything you want Anything you want  Can you call a rose by any other name?  Say There's one thing [3x] A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose There's no other flower in my heart that grows Arose is a rose A ro se is a rose My flower My rose, my flower Growing, growing, growing, baby Yes you are  ",

Still I be getting lonely for you I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay  [Verse 2: 2Pac] I call you up long distance, on the telephone Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home I whisper things in your ear like you're near me Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me? It seems to me, that you're jealous \u2018Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up! Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier And there's no way I'ma stop making money \u2018Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny Always complaining, saying we don't spend time Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind? And hanging up like you all that Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back Please, ain't nothing left to say to you Thugs get lonely too, you know  [Hook]  [Verse 3: 2Pac] I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care Talking out loud to you, like you're there Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on You're the first face I wanna see when I get home Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild Touching every wall in the house, thug style Put your hands on the headboard, think of me Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down Reminisce and relax \u2018cause, baby, right now I feel it in the middle of my stomach You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me \u2018Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true And thugs get lonely too, you know  [Hook]  [Outro: 2Pac] Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin' Aye, so you remember that Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby Thugs get lonely too We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems If you wanna be real with me, be real with me If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me  ",
