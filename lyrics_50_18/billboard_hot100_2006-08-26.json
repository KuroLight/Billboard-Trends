Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  [Verse 2] Dreams of his crash won\u2019t pass Oh, how they all adored him Beauty will last when spiraled down The stars that mystify He left them all behind And how his children cried He left us all behind  [Chorus] Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  [Bridge] What's the hook, the twist Within this verbose mystery? I would gladly bet my life upon it That the ghost you love, your ray of light Will fizzle out without hope We're the empty set just floating through, wrapped in skin Ever searching for what we were promised Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?  [Chorus] Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Hey, Miss Murder, can I? Make beauty stay if I Take my life?  [Video]  ",
