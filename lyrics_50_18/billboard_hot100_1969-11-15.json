Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is  And when I was 12 years old My daddy took me to the circus, The greatest show on earth There were clowns and elephants, dancing bears And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads As I sat there watching I had the feeling that something was missing I don't know what When it was all over I said to myself \"Is that all there is to the circus?\"  [Chorus] Is that all there is? Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is  And then I fell in love With the most wonderful boy in the world We'd take long walks down by the river Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes We were so very much in love Then one day he went away And I thought I'd die, but I didn't And when I didn't, I said to myself \"Is that all there is to love?\"  Is that all there is? is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep...  I know what you must be saying to yourselves \"If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?\" Oh, no. Not me I'm not ready for that final disappointment Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you And when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself  [Chorus] Is that all there is?
