Better do you cause I damn sure does me And what your buzz be is only because of me The wifey, hus-by, never was me I does me, trust me I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup) But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay  [Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {unlisted J.D. ad libs}]  [Fabolous] Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne Now, baby that lime with that Patron Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home Now, I talk with someone above It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love Don't lose someone you love though over your pride Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side We break up to make up at Jacob's baby Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby Wake up baby, love'll have you open though I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show So I just can't bet on the next hand There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man  [Hook]  [Fabolous] Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it The next rap to show you I really been through it Every other day I'm givin the love away That's what your friend's sister or little brother say If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way And others may not see that we need each other But if we on the same page we can read each other They should learn us, instead of try to turn us Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~! If you love your baby then turn this up Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up We already straight - yesss  [Hook]  [Jermaine Dupri] Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man! Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this Uhhh, T-Pain!  [T-Pain] I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy But it's hard for me to let you GO~!  ",
