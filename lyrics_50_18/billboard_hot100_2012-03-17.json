Yeah  [Chorus] Shake it out, shake it out Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa Shake it out, shake it out Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off, oh whoa Shake it out, shake it out Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa Shake it out, shake it out Shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off, oh whoa Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  [Outro] (What the hell) (What the hell) What the hell What the hell What the hell  ",
