Get down to business, Mr. Businessman If you can Before it's too late and you throw your life away  Did you see your children growing up today And did you hear the music of their laughter As they set about to play? Did you catch the fragrance of those roses in your garden?  Did the morning sunlight warm your soul Brighten up your day? Do you qualify to be alive Or is the limit of your senses so as only to survive?  Spending counterfeit incentive Wasting precious time and health Placing value on the worthless Disregarding priceless wealth You can wheel and deal the best of them Steal it from the rest of them You know the score, their ethics are a bore  Eighty-six proof anesthetic crutches Prop you to the top Where the smiles are all synthetic And the ulcers never stop When they take that final inventory  Yours will be the same sad story everywhere No one will really care, no one more lonely than This rich important man Let's have your autograph, endorse your epitaph  You better take care of business, Mr. Businessman What's your plan? Get down to business, Mr. Businessman If you can Hey, yeah, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah  ",

We're always told repeatedly The very best in life is free And if you want to prove it's true Baby I'm telling you This is what you should do Just help yourself to my lips To my arms just say the word, and they are yours Just help yourself to the love, In my heart your smile has opened up the door The greatest wealth that exists in the world, Could never buy what I can give Just help yourself to my lips To my arms, and then lets really start to live  Allllllllll right. Yeah  My heart has love enough for two More than enough for me and you I'm rich with love, a millionaire I've so much, it's unfair Why don't you take a share Just help yourself to my lips To my arms just say the word, and they are yours Just help yourself to the love, In my heart your smile has opened up the door The greatest wealth that exists in the world Could never buy what I can give So help yourself to my lips, to my arms And then lets really start to live Just help yourself to my lips To my arms just say the word, and they are yours Just help yourself to the love  In my heart your smile............
