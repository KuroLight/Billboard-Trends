[Verse 1] Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you? And I refuse to let you play me for a fool You said that we could possibly spend eternity See, that's what you told me (that's what you said) But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams (If you really want me, babe)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? (Tell me, baby) And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"?  [Verse 2] You said you want my love and you've got to have it all But first, there are some things you need to know If you want to live with all I have to give I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah I don't want you trying to get with me And I end up unhappy (Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth (If I spend my life with you)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"? If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me?
