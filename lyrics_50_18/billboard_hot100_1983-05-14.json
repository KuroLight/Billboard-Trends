I cannot believe it's true Are you really doing the things you do No I cannot believe it's you, really you  [Verse 2] Oh these people I'm talking to don't understand They don't seem to realize They're listening but they're not hearing me They're being too cruel to be kind Any kind of feeling that I had is gone Because I gave it all, it's gone And I gave it all to you Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine  [Pre-Chorus] Oh, d'you hear me? I cannot believe it's true Are you really doing the things you do No I cannot believe it's you, really you  [Chorus] Over and over I keep on telling myself Over and over I hope I'm gonna make up Over and over I know it's really happening And there's nothing that I can say Because nothing can change all the things that you've done to me Nothing can make me stay Oh, Because you know I cannot believe it's true Are you really doing the things you do No I cannot believe it's you, really you  [Verse 3] I know it's a crying shame, it's all the same to you It seems all so well laid out but I cannot get through Never meant it to show It started happening, that's all you know  [Bridge] Oh, I gave it all to you Now I'm living on borrowed time, but it's mine  [Pre-Chorus]  [Chorus]  ",
