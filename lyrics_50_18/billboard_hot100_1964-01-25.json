That ever since we met you've had a hold on me It happens to be true I only want to be with you  It doesn't matter where you go or what you do I want to spend each moment of the day with you Oh, look what has happened with just one kiss I never knew that I could be in love like this It's crazy but it's true I only want to be with you  You stopped and smiled at me And asked if I'd care to dance I fell into your open arms And I didn't stand a chance  Now listen honey I just want to be beside you everywhere As long as we're together, honey, I don't care 'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see? That ever since we met you've had a hold on me No matter what you do I only want to be with you  Oh, you stopped and you smiled at me And asked if I'd care to dance I fell into your open arms I didn't stand a chance  Now hear me tell you I just want to be beside you everywhere As long as we're together, honey, I don't care 'Cause you've started something, oh, can't you see? That ever since we met you've had a hold on me No matter what you do I only want to be with you I said, no matter, no matter what you do I only want to be with you  ",

Baby, it's a dream come true, standing right alongside of you; Wish I could show you how much I care, but I only have the nerve to stare...  I can feel a something pounding in my brain Just anytime that someone speaks your name... Trumpets sound, I hear thunder boom Every time that you walk in the room... Every time that you walk in the room... Every time that you walk in the room... Every time that you walk in the room... Every time that you walk in the room...  ",

Looks like there was someone walking the floor If I'm not mistaken, her heart was breaking  Wonder what went wrong Not a thing looks right And I don't know why All I know is last night we quarrelled And you said goodbye. I wish I knew just  Who's been sleeping in my bed? Who's been crying' on my pillow? Who else can it be? It has to be me I'm the one who's weeping instead of sleeping 'Cause you're gone from me, not a thing looks right Wish I knew just who's been sleeping in my bed  ",
