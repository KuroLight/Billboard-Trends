I dreamed about my mother, dear old Papa, Sister and brother,  I dreamed about that girl who's been waiting for so long. I wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I wanna go home!  Home, folks think I'm big in Detroit City. From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine. But by day, I make the cars, and by night I make the bars, If only they could read between the lines!  [Spoken]  You know, I rode a freight train north to Detroit City. After all these years, I find that I've just been wastin' my time. So I just think I'll take my foolish pride, put on a south bound freight and ride, Goin' back to the love ones, The ones I left waitin' so far behind.  I wanna go home, I wanna go home, oh, how I want to go home.  ",
