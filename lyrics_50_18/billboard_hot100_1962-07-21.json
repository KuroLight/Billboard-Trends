Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby.\" (laughter) You know what I mean!
