Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...  In the southern part of Texas Near the town of San Antone Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone And he sees the cattle grazin' where a century before Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar And his eyes turn sorta misty And his heart begins to glow And he takes his hat off slowly...
