O'dell] Even though you gone away (Even though you gone, you ain't never gon' be forgotten) I know you in a better place ('Cause as long as I'm here You gon' live through me and other TRU playas) I really miss my homies Even though their gone away I know you in a better place And I hope to see ya soon someday  [Silkk] I'm just sittin' here dazed thinkin' about all the times we had Thinkin' about the past, some was good and some was bad Remember Dante? It was a group of us, just a group of five Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive To all my soldiers before me, may y'all rest in peace When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me Wishin' I could rewind time like demos Me and you gettin' girls, writin' down numbers like memos Makin' million dollar bets, makin' all our money stretch like limos Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry But if I close my eyes and visualize me together then I suddenly wanna smile See you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us Even though you was wrong, I never could believe that that was true You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos See me and P and C forever gon be ridin' and thuggin' Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it And rest in peace to my brother We gon' miss you  (I love these fools) I know you in a better place (Every time I get on my knees) And I hope to see ya soon someday (I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin' Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)  ",

They say keep the one's you love close (Why'd you have to be so low down?) And your enemy's even closer But I can't win for losin', girl (You were the closest thing to me baby) Cause the one I thought was a friend to me Ended up being my true enemy (Knowin' all of the pain you caused me) Listen to me, baby I gave you everything My love and my ring And you violated me  [Chorus] And I don't wanna see you again I don't ever wanna see you again But I stuck by you till the end And my conscience is clear (so clear) And I can move on from here (move on from here) But I wish I could say the same for you, baby (I'm gonna say a prayer for you baby) I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't wanna see you no more) But tell me why did it have to be my best friend? That you were messin' around with I didn't want to notice it I was true to my love for you  [Chorus] I don't ever wanna see you again (Never would be too soon) But I stuck by you till the end (I'd rather have a cold day in June) And my conscience is clear (So clear) And I can move on from here But I wish I could say the same for you, baby (I need you right now, but...) I don't ever wanna see you again (I don't ever wanna see you. You know I don't really need you) But tell me why did it have to be my best friend?

Go outside  Kiss the rain Whenever you need me Kiss the rain Whenever I'm gone too long  If your lips feel lonely and thirsty Kiss the rain And wait for the dawn Keep in mind  We're under the same sky And the night's As empty for me as for you If you feel You can't wait till morning Kiss the rain, kiss the rain, kiss the rain  Hello, do you miss me? I hear you say you do But not the way I'm missing you  What's new? How's the weather? Is it stormy where you are? You sound so close but it feels like you're so far Oh, would it mean anything  If you knew What I'm left imagining In my mind, my mind Would you go? Would you go?  Kiss the rain  As you fall over me Think of me, think of me Think of me, only me  Kiss the rain Whenever you need me Kiss the rain Whenever I'm gone too long  If your lips Feel hungry and tempted Kiss the rain And wait for the dawn  Keep in mind We're under the same sky And the nights As empty for me as for you  If you feel You can't wait till morning  Kiss the rain Kiss the rain Kiss the rain Kiss the rain  Kiss the rain Kiss the rain Kiss the rain  Hello, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  ",
