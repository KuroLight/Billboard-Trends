I could never win  Never found a compromise Collected lovers like butterflies Illusions of that grand first prize Are slowly wearin' thin Susie, baby, you were good to me Giving love unselfishly But you took it all too seriously I guess it had to end  I was only joking, my dear Looking for a way to hide my fear What kind of fool was I? I could never win  Now you ask me if I'm sincere That's the question that I always fear Verse seven is never clear But I'll tell you what you want to hear I try to give you all you want But giving love is not my strongest point If that's the case, it's pointless going on I'd rather be alone  Cause what I'm doing must be wrong Pouring my heart out in a song Owning up for prosperity For the whole damn world to see  Quietly now while I turn a page Act one is over without costume change The principal would like to leave the stage The crowd don't understand  ",
