Would you still have love for me? Girl It's easy to love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still have love for me?  [Verse 1: 50 Cent] If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me? If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me? If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally? If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends? If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side? If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride? I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside If I ain't rap \u2018cause I flip burgers at Burger King Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me? In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that? If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back? Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap And we could go do what you like, I know you like that  [Hook: Nate Dogg] Girl It's easy to love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still have love for me? Girl It's easy to love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still have love for me?  [Verse 2: 50 Cent] Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'? Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'? Are you mad \u2018cause I'm askin' you 21 questions? Are you my soulmate? \u2018Cause if so, girl, you a blessing Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams? I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans If I was down, would you say things to make me smile? I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me Would you believe me, or up and leave me? How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone? We only humans, girl, we make mistakes To make it up, I'll do whatever it take I love you like a fat kid love cake You know my style, I say anything to make you smile  [Hook: Nate Dogg] Girl It's easy to love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still have love for me? Girl It's easy to love me now Would you love me if I was down and out? Would you still have love for me?  [Outro: Nate Dogg] Could you love me in a Bentley?

If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong? With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug If you never know truth, then you never know love Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know) And where's the love y'all?

Father, father, father, help us Send some guidance from above These people got me, got me questionin'  [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] Where is the love? (love) Where is the love?

Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found Now ask yourself\u2026  [Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake] Where is the love? Where is the love? Where is the love? Where is the love? Father, father, father, help us Send some guidance from above These people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love?
