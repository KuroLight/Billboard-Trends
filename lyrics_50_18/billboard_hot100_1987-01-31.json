How can we make things right? Ooh and why, why is the world so unkind? We surely can find peace of mind If we only see the light Can't you see that?  [Chorus 2]  [Verse 2] Can somebody tell me why? Why do our dreams go wrong? Why can't we all belong? Oh where did we start? Oh and tell me when When will we ever learn There's nowhere else we can turn The truth is in our hearts Here we are together  [Bridge] Sometimes the road gets hard to travel Sometimes the pains too much to bear Sometimes when life seems to unravel That's the time oh to say We're going to make it anyway Can't you see that?
