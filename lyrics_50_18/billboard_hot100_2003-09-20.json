If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong? With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug If you never know truth, then you never know love Where's the love, y'all?

Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found Now ask yourself\u2026  [Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake] Where is the love?

Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'? Call me whatever cause your words don't mean a thing Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing If you look back in history It's a common double standard of society The guy gets all the glory, the more he can score While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore I don't understand why it's okay The guy can get away with it, the girl gets named All my ladies come together and make a change And start a new beginning for us, everybody sing  [Hook: Christina Aguilera & (Lil' Kim)] This is for my girls all around the world (Yeah) Who've come across a man who don't respect your worth Thinkin' all woman should be seen not heard (You can't get rid of us) So what do we do girls?
