Any place is all right as long as I Can forget I've ever known her? Wind creepin' down the neck of my shirt Like I ain't got nothin' on But I'd rather fight the wind and rain Than what I've been fightin' at home Yonder comes a truck with the U.S. Mail People writin' letters back home Tomorrow she'll probably want me back But I'll be just as gone Is anybody goin' to San Antone Or Phoenix, Arizona? Any place is all right as long as I Can forget I've ever known her?  ",
