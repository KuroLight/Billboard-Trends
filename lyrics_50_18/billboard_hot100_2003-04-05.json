[Verse 1] Be, b-boys and girls, listen up You can be anything in the world, in God we trust An architect, doctor, maybe an actress But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old No fun 'cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath 'Cause she smells of corrosion and death Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring 'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how Put your hands in the air, and take the vow  [Hook] I know I can (I know I can!)

        "lyrics": "  [Verse 1] These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out 'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stockin' cap His step-father hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose, his house is a broken home There's no control, he just lets his emotions go  [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  [Verse 2] Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely \u2018cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously So I'm signin' CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, B It's all political, if my music is literal And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you!  [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Sing this shit!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  [Verse 3] They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they wanna get one \u2018cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry, at night, wishin' they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes That's why we seize the moment Try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it \u2018Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can\u2026  [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  ",
