Mercy, mercy wish your heart was a heart of stone Get the picture: no room for the innocent Peak season in Lonely Town Knocked out of the ring by love Are you down and up or up and down? I asked the river for a sign (In my dreams we go on together) How long is love supposed to shine? (In my dreams diamonds are forever) But you and I - we hurt together, hurt alone Don't you sometimes wish your heart was a heart of stone?
