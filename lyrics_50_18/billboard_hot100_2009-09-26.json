So we can finally fly off into NASA You was always the cheerleader of my dream That seem to only date the head of football teams And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing We were never meant to be baby we just happened So please don't mess up the trick Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us Let the hourglass pass right into ashes Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses So I wrote this love letter right before my classes How could a goddess ask someone that's only average For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch Woe is me baby this is tragic Cause we had it, we was magic I was flying now I'm crashing This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him  [Verse 4: Keri Hilson] So you got to take the good with the bad, happy and the sad And let it bring a better future than I had in the past Oh, cause I don't want to make the same mistakes I did I don't want to fall back on my face again I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call And if it hits better make it worth the fall  [Hook] Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down  [Outro: Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo] Won't see it coming when it happens But when it happens You're gonna feel it let me tell you now You see when love comes and knocks you down Yeah Won't see it coming when it happens But when it happens You're gonna feel it let me tell you now You see when love comes and knocks you down Yeah  ",
