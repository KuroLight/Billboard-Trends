Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah  [Verse 1: 2Pac] Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin' No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales Hustlers hardly think of culture Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures Why shed tears? Save your sympathy My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me! Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!  [Hook: Johnny P] Smile for me, won't you smile? Just smile, smile for me Smile for me Won't you smile? Just smile  [Verse 3: 2Pac] Fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's Backstabbed and bleedin' Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin' Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain? Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries The best revenge is \"Fuck friends!\" \u2013 we military minded soldiers Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words, make the world change And still I smile, nigga  [Bridge: Scarface] And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outerspace May the angels help to lead the way May the prayers that our families made Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac  [Hook: Johnny P] Smile, smile for me All you need to do is smile Woooo smile for me Come on, smile for me  ",
