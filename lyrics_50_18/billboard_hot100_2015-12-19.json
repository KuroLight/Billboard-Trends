Oooh, ooh, yeah, they'll be alright Ooh, I just wanna see you shine  Girl you're tearing that dance floor up Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck You sure know how to shake it alright Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows Just me and you parked on the edge of the world That's how I wanna see you girl Yeah, let me see you girl  Whatcha think about taking that chance Taking a ride, taking my hand Kicking this crowd, ditching this club? This night's been waiting on us Ooh, ooh, save your best moves, ooh, ooh Yeah, 'til I get us where we're getting to  Girl you're tearing that dance floor up Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck You sure know how to shake it alright Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows Just me and you park on the edge of the world That's how I wanna see you girl  I can see you getting my tailgate rocking Moving your hips like wind moves cotton You can get the whole wide country side hopping  Bring the beat back Aw, come on with me girl  Yeah, you're tearing that dance floor up Let me see you do it in the bed of my truck You sure know how to shake it alright Let me see you do it in the Tennessee moonlight Whoa, baby let's go down a little road nobody else knows Just me and you park on the edge of the world That's how I wanna see you girl Yeah, let me see you girl Come on come on come on, let me see you girl  ",
