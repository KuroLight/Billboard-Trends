I'll take it, frame by frame it To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it O is for \"other,\" P is for \"peoples',\" scratch your temple The last P, well, that's not that simple It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten It's five little letters that are missin' here You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin' It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello You get her name and number And then left feelin' real mellow You get home, wait a day She's what you wanna know about, then you call up And it\u2019s her girlfriend\u2019s or her cousin\u2019s house?! It\u2019s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T; It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Oh, that\u2019s why she\u2019s scary) It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it But if you don't, here's your membership  [Hook] You down with O.P.P.?

You looked at him, he looked at you And you knew right away He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway! You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care 'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there When y'all are finished, y'all can leave And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do' Now don't be shy 'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high Say O.P.P.

I'm pretty good with first impressions But sometimes I'm not always right I pulled the car to the shoulder of the road To see what she had in mind \"Want me to spend the night Hey, lover boy, you know I will And my best girlfriend that lives down the road Together we will thrill ya\" And I'm thinking to myself I could be lucky Pierre tonight  If I could get a leg up If I could get a leg over, boy You know I ain't that handsome But you know I ain't shy, shy, shy  The rest of the night went on and on And the moral to this song Don't go making hasty judgments Because sometimes they could be wrong Nothing wrong with a good time Just keep yourself protected, make a list And you can bet your life that the women don't know The little girls are acting like this So the next time a young one moves up And she whispers in your ear  Get a leg up Get a leg over, boy Get a leg up Now don't you be shy, shy, shy  Get a leg up Get a leg over, boy You know I ain't that handsome But you know I ain't shy, shy, shy  Get a leg up Get a leg over, boy Get a leg up Now don't you be shy, shy, shy  ",

There's a whole other life Waiting to be lived when One day we're brave enough To talk with conviction of the heart  And down your streets I've walked alone As if my feet were not my own Such is the path I chose Doors I have opened and closed  I'm tired of living this life Fooling myself, believing we're right when I've never given love With any conviction of the heart  One with the earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe we'll survive If we only try  How long must we all wait to change This world bound in chains that we live in To know what it is to forgive and be forgiven?  Too many years of taking now Isn't it time to stop somehow? Air that's too angry to breathe Water our children can't drink  You've heard it Hundreds of times You say you're aware Believe, and you care But do you care enough Where's your conviction of the heart?  One with the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  With the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  One Earth One sky Only one world  Only one chance For one life When will live (With conviction of the heart)  One child One dream And only one life  Give her one chance For one life When will we live  Only one Earth Only one sky Only one world We've only got one chance To live in one life  I believe it's only gonna start When we begin with Some conviction of the heart  ",

She said \"stop lyin'\" Her feelings were hurt, so she broke out cryin' I said baby you gotta help yourself Don't expect help from anyone else This relationship just ain't gonna last Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it But let me tell you one thing I'm not I'm not your [puppet]...

CHORUS You`re the story of my life You`re the one that got me Through the night You`ve been right here by my side When I needed you, when I needed you You were there to make it right If I wrote a book you`d be in every line For all time, you`re the story You`re the story of my life... When I think about tomorrow There`ll be joy and there`ll be sorrow But I know that I will follow you `Cause I`m lost without your love I`ll be there, there when you need me There like the very air you`re breathin` You`re my blood, oh my love CHORUS Through the night No one`s ever known me better baby, through your eyes I can see the mirror of my soul... CHORUS TWICE You`re the story of my life... You`re the story of my life...  ",
