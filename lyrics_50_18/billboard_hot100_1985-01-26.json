Or should I go And change my point of view for other ugly scenes?  You did what you did to me, now it's history I see Things will happen while they can I will wait here for my man tonight It's easy when you're big in Japan  Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side Things are easy when you're big in Japan  Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side Things are easy when you're big in Japan Oh, when you're big in Japan  Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side Things are easy when you're big in Japan  Oh, when you're big in Japan, tonight, big in Japan, be tight Big in Japan, ooh, the eastern sea's so blue Big in Japan, alright, pay then I'll sleep by your side Things are easy when you're big in Japan Oh, when you're big in Japan  ",

That ain't enough for you Said ain't enough... it ain't enough for you  And I could carry the weight of your sad times, dear And give you the strength to face your fears I know I'll never be afraid to say I'm here by your side and I'm gonna stay Just a little closer to you, yeah  I could pour you a drink like I pour out my heart Smile when I'm sad and act dumb when I'm smart But that ain't enough... that ain't enough for you That ain't enough for you  ",

[Chorus] You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out When he comes around Don't make a sound  [Verse 3] Who's this man who fell out of the sky? What's he done and where's he live? How can a man who's a criminal Be a hero to the kids? The old couple swear that the Ripper's back They say it's him all right The young girl says it's Jesus And he won't be back again tonight I wonder who's right  [Chorus] You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out When he comes around You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out There's a stranger in town You better watch out When he comes around Don't make a sound  ",
