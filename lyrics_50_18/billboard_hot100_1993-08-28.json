Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am, just drowning in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  And everything seems cut and dry Day and night Earth and sky Somehow I just don't believe it  Runaway train never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Bought a ticket for a runaway train Like a madman laughing at the rain A little out of touch, a little insane It's just easier than dealing with the pain  Runaway train never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Runaway train never coming back Runaway train tearing up the track Runaway train burning in my veins Runaway but it always seems the same  ",
