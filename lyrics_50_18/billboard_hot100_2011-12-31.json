We do this every night And yet we wake up singing the same song  [Hook: Lily Allen]  [T-Pain] It's 5 o'clock in the morning And you calling And these females got me stalling I can hear your voice in my head like \"What is he doing?\" Cause I keep checking my cell phone And these missed calls You texting me like I'mma kill y'all If you don't get your ass up out of that club And do you know what time it is (It's 5 o'clock in the morning) and my bad, girl And this Nuvo got me trippin And I know that you mad, girl But you ain't got to worry about nothing Girl I got you, girl I got you She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly I don't want her to go crazy We do this every night and then we always wake up singing the same song  [Hook: Lily Allen]  [Wiz Khalifa] You ain't got nothing on But the t-shirt that I left over your house The last time I came and put it on ya Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to Leave here with one of them That's why I call her And you'll be right at home waiting for me Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me Club closed at 6, left around 4:30 Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib..
