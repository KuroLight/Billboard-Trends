Every time I turn on my T.V  I see somebody lovin' somebody Are you getting enough happiness? Are you getting enough of what makes you happy? Are you getting enough happiness? Are you getting enough of what makes you happy?  Every time I open a book  Or read a magazine  There's happy love everywhere I look Every page I turn I can read between the lines  That the boys gonna get it Get it tonight Oh What's the matter with me  Am I the only one  Oh Is there somebody out there who feels the same?  Every time I turn on my radio  I hear a love song playing on every show Are you getting enough happiness?...  I need excitement in my life I need happiness Happiness every night I need someone to call upon when the need is strong  For lovin' For lovin'  Are you gettting enough happiness?...  ",

The caretaker was crucified for sleeping at his post They're refusing to be pacified it's him they blame the most The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas And everyone's concerned about industrial disease  [Verse 2] There's panic on the switchboard tongues are ties in knots Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots Some blame the management some the employees And everybody knows it's the industrial disease Yeah, now the work force is disgusted downs tools and walks Innocence is injured experience just talks Everyone seeks damages and everyone agrees That these are 'classic symptoms of a monetary squeeze' On ITV and BBC they talk about the curse Philosophy is useless theology is worse History boils over there's an economics freeze Sociologists invent words that mean 'industrial disease'  [Verse 3] Doctor Parkinson declared \"I'm not surprised to see you here You've got smoker's cough from smoking, brewer's droop from drinking beer I don't know how you came to get the Betty Davis' knees But worst of all young man you've got industrial disease\" He wrote me a prescription he said \"You are depressed But I'm glad you came to see me to get this off your chest Come back and see me later - next patient please Send in another victim of industrial disease\"  [Verse 4] And I go down to Speaker's Corner I'm thunderstruck They got free speech, tourists, police in trucks Two men say they're Jesus one of them must be wrong There's a protest singer, He's singing a protest song - he says They want to have a war to keep their factories They want to have a war to keep us on our knees They want to have a war to stop us buying Japanese They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind They want to sap your energy incarcerate your mind Give you Rule Brittania, gassy beer, page three Two weeks in Espana and Sunday striptease' Meanwhile the first Jesus says \"I'd cure it soon Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons\" The other one's on a hunger strike he's dying by degrees How come Jesus gets industrial disease  ",
