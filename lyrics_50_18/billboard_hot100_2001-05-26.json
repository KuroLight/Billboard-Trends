Through the misery that came to pass The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask For currency, but you could run to me when you need And I'll never leave, honestly Someone to believe in, as you can see It's a small thing to a true, what could I do? Real homies help you get through And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could \u2018Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same Until the end of time  [Hook: R.L. Huggar] So take these broken wings I need your hands to come and heal me once again (Until the end of time) So I can fly away, until the end of time Until the end of time, until the end of time  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids So you know, I don't hang around the house much This all-night money makin' got me outta touch Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs My attitude got me walkin' solo Ride out alone in my lo-lo Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin' Who can I trust in this cold world? My phony homie had a baby by my old girl But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin' Until the end of time  [Hook: R.L.

Remain strong in this planet full of player haters They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy Made all my enemies envy me So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha) When I conceive closer to achieve In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need An ounce of game and the training to make a G Remember me as an outcast Outlaw Another album out, that's what I'm about: more Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me Until the end of time  [Hook: R.L.

If I gotta pay to get in the club I'mma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P My dress code is all black when I'm making the moves Similar to the new Playstation 2 I can't help it if the club only packing a G And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3 And you balling ass niggas, whose dressed to kill For the hoes showing the toes with extra heels (man!) I gotta get in, I drove here With a car load of bitches charged on Belvedere My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch  [DJ Kool] Yo Red, wassup man?

I've been in this line for hours I even killed the time by helping my man pass out fliers Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in JUMP, MOVE, CRASH, SMOKE, DRINK Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think? Poppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pouring Since +Def+ is the label I belong in a morgue! I'm walking half-dead, acting senile With bigger niggas from jail than the one on \"Green Mile\" I'll huff and puff, blow the club down I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown  [DJ Kool] Yeah that's right!
