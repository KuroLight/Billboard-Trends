I've got a question Can I throw it all away? Take back what's mine So I take my time Guiding the blade down the line Each cut closer to the vein Vein, vein  [Pre-Chorus] This state is elevating As the hurt turns into hating Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!  [Chorus] The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah) This shit's gone way too far All this time, I've been waiting Oh, I cannot grieve anymore For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah) I'm not, I'm not a whore You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah) Oh, I cannot give any more  [Refrain] I'm here to stay (ha-aah) Bring it down! (aah) I'm here to stay (aah) Bring it down! (aah) I'm here to stay (aah) Bring it down! (aah) I'm here to stay (aah)  [Breakdown] Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it down! Gonna break it!  [Pre-Chorus] This state is elevating As the hurt turns into hating Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!  [Chorus] The hurt inside is fading (aah-aah-aah) This shit's gone way too far All this time, I've been waiting Oh, I cannot grieve anymore For what's inside awaking (aah-aah-aah) I'm not, I'm not a whore You've taken everything and (aah-aah-aah) Oh, I cannot give any more  [Outro] (Aah-aah-aah) Give any more! (aah-aah-aah) Give any more! (aah-aah-aah) Give any more! (aah-aah-aah) Give any more!  ",
