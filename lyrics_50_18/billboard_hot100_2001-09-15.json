[Verse 3] Hov is back, life stories told through rap Niggas acting like I sold you crack Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that So hopefully you won't have to go through that I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed? Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law So you know I seen it all before I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight To try and to fail: the two things I hate Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy  [Hook] H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

Wearing a jacket, who's property Said you'd been queuing for a taxi But you left all your money on the TV Can you fill me in?

The down low happening to me all over again And then I turned the TV down Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound, something going on upstairs Cause I know no one else lives here \"Bump bump bump\" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear Then I hear my babies voice in my ear screamin'....  [Hook]  [Verse 3:] Ron: What the hell is going on between the sheets in my home? Chante: Baby wait let me explain before you start to point your cane Ron: Girl, I'm about to have a fit R. Kelly: \"Oh it's about to be some shit!\" How did I get in to this? Should have never came home with this bitch!
