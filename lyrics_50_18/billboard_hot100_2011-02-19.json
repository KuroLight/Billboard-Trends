De buenos aires hasta Madrid (hay ole!) Y sin dormirnos acabar con par\u00eds Te juro que jam\u00e1s te vas a arrepentir  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] Si es amor, Abr\u00e1zame con ganas Si no lo es, tal vez ser\u00e1 ma\u00f1ana Estando juntos mi mundo se llena de luz Lo mejor de mi vida eres tu Eres t\u00fa Dame d\u00e1melo baby Lo mejor lo mejor Eres t\u00fa  [Bridge] Su\u00e9ltate el pelo y juega entre las olas (entre las olas) Sobre la arena a la orilla del mar (la orilla del mar) Prep\u00e1rate que la noche no perdona Ven que nos vamos de marcha otra vez Ma\u00f1ana, ma\u00f1ana  [Chorus]  [Outro] Eres t\u00fa Dame d\u00e1melo baby Lo mejor lo mejor lo mejor Lo mejor de mi vida eres tu [x2] Dame d\u00e1melo baby  ",
