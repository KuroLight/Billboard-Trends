Don't stop, don't stop giving me things  [Bridge] (These are one of those times when we're gonna have a lot of fun)  [Verse 2] I run they run everybody run run And we're all just having fun Sleigh ride boat ride piggy back ride I'm going to show them all how I can ride One two three close your eyes and count to four I'm gonna hide behind my bedroom door Crayons on walls I'll color on them all I'll draw until I've broken every law  [Chorus] I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me Stop! Don't stop, don't stop giving me things Stop! Don't stop, don't stop laughing about it Stop! Don't stop, don't stop Don't stop Don't stop Don't stop Don't stop  [Outro] I said don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking to me Stop! Don't stop, don't stop giving me things Stop! Don't stop, don't stop laughing about it I said it! Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop talking I said it! Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop giving me things I said it! Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop laughing about it I said it! Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop with me  ",
