(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you?  Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Think it over Think it over  I've known of your, your secluded nights I've even seen her, maybe one or twice But is her sweet expression Worth more than my love and affection?  This time before you leave my arms And rush off to her charms (Think it over) Haven't I been good to you? (Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?  Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Think it over Think it over  I've tried so hard, hard to be patient Hoping you'll stop this infatuation But each time you are together I'm so afraid of losing you forever  Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart (Baby, think it over) Stop in the name of love (Think it over, baby) Before you break my heart (Ooh, think it over, baby)  Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart  ",

But she said what to me She's coming home And so I'll cry no more I'll dry my tears  She's coming home to me She's coming home to me  But she said what to me She's coming home And so I'll cry no more I'll dry my tears  She's coming home to me She's coming home to me She's coming home to me, oh  ",
