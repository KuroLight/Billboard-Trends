You don't come home till 4 AM cause you're roaming In the streets somewhere, downtown We would feel swell if only someone would tell us What goes on down there, downtown But every time we ask you what you're doing after dark there You just say that you were frugging to Petula Clark there That's what I mean So, kids, give your folks a break Because you're driving us crazy, we sit here all night and take Milltown, swallowing pills so we'll Calm down, counting the hours you're Downtown, you and your frug and your slop  While we're lying there we try to watch the television Then you call us up and say you've had a slight collision There goes the car Besides that you've been arrested So we've got to get up, and we've got to get dressed and go Downtown, borrow a car and go Downtown, that's where you are, you finks Downtown, wait 'till I get you kids home  (Spoken) There'll be no more frugging, no swim, no jerk, no mashed potato, no slop! And you know what else? You're gonna stay home tonight, and your mother and I are going downtown and we're going to dance the tango, and the waltz, and the foxtrot, and we're gonna do the bunny hop.
