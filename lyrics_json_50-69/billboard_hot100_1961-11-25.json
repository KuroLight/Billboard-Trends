The young have problems Many problems We need an understanding heart.. Why don't they help us, try to help us Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...  Take these eager lips and hold me fast.. I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two..

Little alter boy, please let me hear you pray  Lift up your voice and send a prayer above Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love Now I know my life has been all wrong Lift up your voice and help a sinner be strong  Little alter boy, I wonder could you pray for me? Could you tell our lord I'm going to change my way today? What must I do, to be holy like you? Little alter boy, oh let me hear you pray Little alter boy, please let me hear you pray  ",
