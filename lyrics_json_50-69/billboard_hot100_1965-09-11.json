How does it feel? To be without a home? Like a complete unknown? Like a rolling stone?

How does it feel? To be on your own With no direction home A complete unknown Like a rolling stone?  [Verse 3] Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you Never understood that it ain't no good You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat Ain't it hard when you discover that He really wasn't where it's at After he took from you everything he could steal?  [Chorus 3] How does it feel? How does it feel? To hang out on your own With no direction home Like a complete unknown Like a rolling stone?  [Verse 4] Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made Exchangin' all precious gifts But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya' better pawn it, babe You used to be so amused At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used Go to him now, he calls ya', ya' can't refuse When ya' ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose You're invisible now, ya' got no secrets to conceal  [Chorus 2] How does it feel?
