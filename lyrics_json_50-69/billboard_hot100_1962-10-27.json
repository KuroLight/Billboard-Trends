Fight for the winnin' and I'll be there If there's one more song, I'll be singin'. I'm always goin' but I don't know where  Sailed up to New York on a schooner, but I won't be stayin' there long There were bright city lights and girls in pink tights but their faces were all painted on  If there's one more town, I'll be goin'.
