You could hear him swear Hey, watch out, there, Snoopy. You're really in a mess You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron But it looks like he's not down, yet  Then a cry went up all over the land The bloody Red Baron would strike again But, brave, little Snoopy said, \"Never fear.\" As he headed for his plane, all the people cheered Hey, watch out, little Snoopy. You're really in a mess You thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron But it looks like he's not down, yet  Snoopy blazed a trail straight across the sea Searching in vain for his enemy Then he found that German trying to fix his plane; A-sweatin' and a-flustered, about to go insane  Snoopy landed for a pistol duel The Baron was worried; Snoopy was cool He fired a shot, missed, started to run Before Snoopy had a chance to raise his gun Hey, watch out, Red Baron. Snoopy is on your trail One of these days, he's gonna make you pay, and you'll go straight to Well, watch out, Red Baron.
