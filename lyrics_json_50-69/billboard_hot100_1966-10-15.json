Without an education You might as well be dead  [Chorus 2] One more time What do you say? Without an education You might as well be dead  [Verse 2] My friends told all his buddies That he loved so well And of their personal troubles I will not tell Now those guys didn't seem good And they didn't seem bad They didn't seem so happy And I know they weren't sad But the point isn't That they follow the rules They got an education And they all been in school Now underneath his tears I could see the true fact When he dropped out of school He never, never went back  [Chorus 1]  [Chorus 2] Got to, got to, got to listen now, now What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Vesre 3] So one day he got tired Of his little spending change So he looked up his friends To check their pay range When he got there, the crib He found that he was a drag Because man, they were clean And his clothes were like rags One was a business man With the plenty of dough He had his thing so set up You know he couldn't blow The other had his job so uptight He had his whole family And his kids all out of sight  [Chorus 1] Tell me one more time now What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Chorus 2] You got to, got to, got to get a little learning What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Verse 3] What made him so hurt That these were his friends and he was a drag They looked at him And he was in the same old bag For his friends they worked real hard When the work day was through Now, he realized He should have done the same thing too  [Chorus 1] Tell me one more time now What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Chorus 2] You got to, got to, got to get a little learning now What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Verse 4] For the last time, I'm gonna say They kept on pushing When the going was tough And now they know That things don't seem so rough So kids, stay in school Don't be no drag Take a fool's advise And stay out of that bag  [Chorus 1] Look here, tell me, Bobby tell me one more time What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Chorus 1] Tell me, The Jewels, tell me now one more time What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Chorus 1] Everybody, tell me one more time What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Chorus 2] You got to, got to, got to, got to get some learning now What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Bridge] Don't be a drop-out, stay in school now listen to me What do you say? Kids, kids Might as well be dead No, no What do you say? Without an education Might as well be dead  [Outro] Stay in school, have a good time What do you say? Don't, don't, don't ever blame Don't ever blame, don't ever blame, come on  ",
