But now he's back in my arms again Right by my side I got him back in my arms again So satisfied  It's easy for friends to say let him go But I'm the one who needs him so It's his love that makes me strong Without him I can't go on  This time I'll live my life at ease Being happy lovin' whom I please And each time we make romance I'll be thankful for a second chance  Ooh! Cause he's back in my arms again Right by my side I got him back in my arms again So satisfied Ooh!  How can Mary tell me what to do When she lost her love so true? And Flo, she don't know Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo  I listened once to my friends' advice But it's not gonna happen twice Cause all advice ever gotten me Was many long and sleepless nights  Ooh!
