Tell the socialites to look the other way It's instinctive stimulation you convey It's a necessary function Meant for those without compunction Who get tired of vanilla every day  Sweet cream ladies forward march Puritans ignore them Sweet cream ladies do their part Sweet cream men adore them Let them satisfy the ego of the male Let them fabricate success to those who fail And should penalties pursue them When there's really credit due them They might keep a simple fellow out of jail!

Tell me the thoughts that surround you I want to look inside your head, yes I do  I've seen all your qualifications You got from the Sorbonne And the painting you stole from Picasso Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does  When you go on your summer vacation You go to Juan-les-Pins With your carefully designed topless swimsuit You get an even suntan on your back, and on your legs  And when the snow falls you're found in St. Moritz With the others of the jet set And you sip your Napoleon brandy But you never get your lips wet, no you don't  But where do you go to my lovely When you're alone in your bed? Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you? I want to look inside your head, yes I do  You're in between twenty and thirty That's a very desirable age Your body is firm and inviting But you live on a glittering stage, yes you do, yes you do  Your name is heard in high places You know the Aga Khan He sent you a race horse for Christmas And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha  They say that when you get married It'll be to a millionaire But they don't realize where you came from And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn  But where do you go to my lovely When you're alone in your bed? Tell me the thoughts that surround you I want to look inside your head, yes I do  I remember the back streets of Naples: Two children begging in rags Both touched with a burning ambition To shake off their lowly-born tags, they tried  So look into my face, Marie-Claire And remember just who you are Then go and forget me forever But I know you still bear the scar, deep inside  I know where you go to my lovely When you're alone in your bed I know the thoughts that surround you Cause I can look inside your head  ",
