( sincere! ) Did those pretty little love words mean you're sincere? ( sincere! )  Last night when the moon was bright you said \"I love you!\" And you painted pretty little castles in the air Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk Or did those pretty little castles mean you really care? ( care! ) Did those pretty little castles mean you really care? ( care! )  I know that I . . . meant every sigh When you hugged me the way you hugged me An' you kissed me the way you kissed me In the moonlight! ( Hubba Hubba Hubba Hubba! )  Last night when you held me tight and called me darlin' And you told me that you would die if we should part Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk Or did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( heart! ) Did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( pretty little love words come from your heart! )  Hmmm . . . moon-talk! . . . Hmmm . . . moon-talk! . .  Makes you hug me the way you hugged me Makes you kiss me the way you kissed me In the moonlight! ( I love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya! )  Last night when you held me tight and called me darlin' And you told me that you would die if we should part Was it just moon-talk, only moon-talk Or did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( heart! ) Did those pretty little love words come from your heart? ( pretty little love words come from your heart! )  Moon talk, Oh moon talk!  ",

        "lyrics": "  Let me tell the story, I can tell it all; About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol His daddy made the whiskey, the son he drove the load; And when his engine roared they called the highway \"Thunder Road\"  Sometimes into Ashville, sometimes Memphis town The Revenuers chased him but they couldn't run him down Each time they thought they had him his engine would explode He'd go by like they were standing still on \"Thunder Road\"  And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they swore they'd get him but the devil got him first  It was on the first of April, Nineteen-Fifty-Four The federal man sent word he'd better make his run no more He said \"200 agents were covering the state; Which ever road he tried to take they'd get him sure as fate.\"  'Son' his daddy told him, 'make this run your last The tank is filled with 100 proof; you're all tuned-up and gassed Now don't take any chances, if you can't get through I'd rather have you back again than all that Mountain Dew.'  And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they swore they'ed get him but the devil got him first  Roaring out of Harlan; revving up his mill He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville With G men on his tail light; road block up ahead The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread  Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike He left the road at 90; that's all there is to say The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day  And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first  ",
