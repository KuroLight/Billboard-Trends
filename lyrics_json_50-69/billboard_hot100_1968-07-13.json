You'll never, never, never reach the sky  He mumbles a prayer and it ends with a smile The order is given They move down the line But he'll stay behind and he'll meditate But it won't stop the bleeding or ease the hate  As the young men move out into the battle zone He feels good, with God you're never alone He feels tired and he lays on his bed Hopes the men will find courage In the words that he said Sky pilot Sky pilot How high can you fly? You'll never, never, never reach the sky  {Instrumental}  You're soldiers of God, you must understand The fate of your country is in your young hands May God give you strength Do your job real well If it all was worth it Only time it will tell  In the morning they return With tears in their eyes The stench of death drifts up to the skies A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot Remembers the words \"Thou shalt not kill.\" Sky pilot Sky pilot How high can you fly? You'll never, never, never reach the sky  ",
