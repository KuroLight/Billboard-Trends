Well if she's in the mood No need to break it I got the chance, and I oughta take it If she'll dance, then we can make it Come on queenie, let's shake it  Go, go, go, little queenie Go, go, go, little queenie Go, go, go, little queenie  Tell me, who's the queen Standing over by the record machine Lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen  Meanwhile, I was still thinkin' ...  If it's a slow song, we'll omit it If it's a rocker, that'll get it And if it's good, she'll admit it C'mon queenie, let's get with it  Go, go, go, little queenie Go, go, go, little queenie Go, go, go, little queenie  [Electric guitar outro]  ",
