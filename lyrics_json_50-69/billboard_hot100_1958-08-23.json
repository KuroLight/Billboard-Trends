It looks like a purple eater to me!\"  It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater (One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater) A one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater Sure looks strange to me (One eye?)  Well, he came down to earth and he lit in a tree I said, \"Mr. Purple People Eater, don't eat me!\" I heard him say in a voice so gruff: \"I wouldn't eat you 'cause you're so tough.\"  It was a one-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater One-eyed, one-horned, flyin' purple people eater Sure looks strange to me (One horn?)  I said, \"Mr. Purple People Eater, what's your line?\" He said, \"Eatin' purple people and it sure is fine But that's not the reason that I came to land I wanna get a job in a rock and roll band.\"  Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater (We wear short shorts) Friendly little people What a sight to see!  And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground He started to rock, really rockin' around It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune Sing a bop bap aboopa lappa loom bam boom  Well bless my soul, rock and roll, flyin' purple people eater Pigeon-toed, undergrowed, flyin' purple people eater I like short shorts Flyin' little people eater What a sight to see! (Purple People?)  And then he went on his way, and then what do ya know I saw him last night on a TV show He was blowing it out, a'really knockin' em dead Playin' rock and roll music through the horn in his head  [Sped-up saxophone solo]  Tequila  ",
