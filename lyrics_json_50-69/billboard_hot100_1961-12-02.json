The young have problems Many problems We need an understanding heart.. Why don't they help us, try to help us Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...  Take these eager lips and hold me fast.. I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two..
