Yes I'm starting to sweat You know my shirt's all wet What a feeling In the sound that abounds And resounds and rebounds off the ceiling  You gotta have it baby You can't do without When you get that feeling You gotta sock'em out Put that mike in my hand And let me kick out the jam Yes ! Kick out the jams I want to kick 'em out  So you got to give it up You know you can't get enough Miss McKenzie Cause it gets in your brain It drives you insane With the frenzy  The wigglin guitars girl The crash of the drums Make you wanna keep-a-rockin' Till the morning comes  Let me be who I am And let me kick out the jam Yes, kick out the jams I done kicked em out!
