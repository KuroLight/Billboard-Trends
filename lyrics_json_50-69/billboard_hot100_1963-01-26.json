I can't love another when my hearts somewhere far away  The only girl I care about has gone away Looking for a brand new start But little does she know that when she left that day Along with her she took my heart  {Bridge}  Rain won't you tell her that I love her so Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow  Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain Telling me just what a fool I've been I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain And let me be alone again  Oh, listen to the falling rain Pitter patter, pitter patter Oh, oh, oh, listen to the falling rain Pitter patter, pitter patter  ",
