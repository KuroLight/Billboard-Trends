(Song:) Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charlie On a tragic and fateful day He put ten cents in his pocket, kissed his wife and family Went to ride on the MTA  Well, did he ever return? No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (What a pity) He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston And he's the man who never returned  Charlie handed in his dime at the Kendall Square station And he changed for Jamaica Plain When he got there the conductor told him, \"One more nickel\" Charlie couldn't get off of that train!  But did he ever return? No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (Poor old Charlie) He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned  Now, all night long Charlie rides through the stations Crying, \"What will become of me? How can I afford to see my sister in Chelsea Or my cousin in Roxbury?\"  But did he ever return? No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (Shame and scandal) He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned  Charlie's wife goes down to the Scollay Square station Every day at quarter past two And through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich As the train comes rumbling through!  But did he ever return? No he never returned and his fate is still unlearned (He may ride forever) He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned Pick it Davey (Kinda hurts my fingers)  Now, you citizens of Boston Don't you think it's a scandal How the people have to pay and pay? Fight the fare increase, vote for George O'Brian! Get poor Charlie off the MTA!  Or else he'll never return No he'll never return and his fate is still unlearned (Just like Paul Revere) He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston He's the man who never returned  He's the man who never returned He's the man who never returned He's the man who never returned Et tu, Charlie?

Yeah, I guess so On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew On an evening in Roma  [Verse 2] Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down  [Verse 3] So please meet me in the plaza near your casa I am only one and that's one too few On an evening in Roma  [Refrain 2] Don't know what the country's coming to But in Rome, do as the Romans do Will you, on an evening in Roma?  [Refrain 1] Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare Sotto il cielo di Roma  [Refrain 2] Don't know what the country's coming to But in Rome, do as the Romans do Will you, on an evening in Roma?  [Outro] Sott'er celo de Roma On an evening in Roma  ",
