And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep Her window shades all pulled completely down  Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit Well this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites  No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA  ",
