From the canyons of the mind We wander on and stumble blindly Through the often-tangled maze Of starless nights and sunless days While asking for some kind of clue Or road to lead us to the truth But who will answer?  Side by side two people stand Together vowing, hand-in-hand That love's imbedded in their hearts But soon an empty feeling starts To overwhelm their hollow lives And when they seek the hows and whys Who will answer?  On a strange and distant hill A young man's lying very still His arms will never hold his child Because a bullet running wild Has struck him down. And now we cry \"Dear God, Oh, why, oh, why?\" But who will answer?  High upon a lonely ledge A figure teeters near the edge And jeering crowds collect below To egg him on with, \"Go, man, go!\" But who will ask what led him To his private day of doom And who will answer?  (Chorus) If the soul is darkened By a fear it cannot name If the mind is baffled When the rules don't fit the game Who will answer? Who will answer? Who will answer? Hallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!  In the rooms of dark and shades The scent of sandalwood pervades The colored thoughts in muddled heads Reclining in the rumpled beds Of unmade dreams that can't come true And when we ask what we should do Who... Who will answer?  'Neath the spreading mushroom tree The world revolves in apathy As overhead, a row of specks Roars on, drowned out by discotheques And if a secret button's pressed Because one man has been outguessed Who will answer?  Is our hope in walnut shells Worn 'round the neck with temple bells Or deep within some cloistered walls Where hooded figures pray in halls? Or crumbled books on dusty shelves Or in our stars, or in ourselves Who will answer?  (Repeat Chorus Below) If the soul is darkened By a fear it cannot name If the mind is baffled When the rules don't fit the game Who will answer? Who will answer? Who will answer? Hallelujah!
