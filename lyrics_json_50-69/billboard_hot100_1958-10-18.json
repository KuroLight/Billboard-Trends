When the road was long and weary you gave me a few good mile What do I care if I miss a goal because I make a slip? I'll still be satisfied because I tasted your sweet lips  [Verse 2] What do I care if I never have much money? And sometimes my table looks a little bare Anything that I may miss is made up for each time we kiss You love me and I love you, so what do I care?
