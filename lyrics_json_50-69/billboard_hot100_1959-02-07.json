I said, Why, no, I couldn't do that Why, that just wouldn't be right Cause you and me and me and you We don't even look alike Cause you've got four arms The better to hold you Three lips The better to kiss you Three eyes All the better to see I can really rock and swing Cause I've got more of everything Oh, Mister Earthman, will you marry me? I said, What would people think When we go strolling by Why, they'd not only laugh at us They'd lay right down and die Then they'd put you and me in jail There we would be And the people, they'd come from miles around Just to look at you and me Cause you've got four arms The better to hold you Three lips The better to kiss you Three eyes All the better to see I can really rock and swing Cause I've got more of everything Oh, Mister Earthman, will you marry me? I said, This thing's gone far enough I've had enough of this She said, Please, Mister Earthman Just one little kiss? I said, Okay, okay, okay! But then you go away But when I finished kissing her I had this to say Oh, you've got four arms The better to hold you Three lips The better to kiss you Three eyes All the better to see I can really rock and swing Cause I've got more of everything Oh, Mister Earthman, will you marry me?
