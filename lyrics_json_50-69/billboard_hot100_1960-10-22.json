Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...  In the southern part of Texas Near the town of San Antone Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone And he sees the cattle grazin' where a century before Santa Anna's guns were blazin' and the cannons used to roar And his eyes turn sorta misty And his heart begins to glow And he takes his hat off slowly...

Can't you feel it when we touch? I will never, ever let you go I love you oh so much  It's my dance (you can dance) and I'll carry (you can dance)on Until the night (you can dance) is gone and it's just for fun (you can dance) (you can dance) And you know (you can dance) when it's time (you can dance) to go You'll be (you can dance) the one to take (you can dance) me home (you can dance)  Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you So I'm savin' the last dance for you Don't want to give my goodnight kiss to anyone but you So I'm savin' the last dance for you  Hmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm Savin' the last dance for you  ",
