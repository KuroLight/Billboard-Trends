I bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free But those people keep a-movin' And that's what tortures me  Well if they freed me from this prison If that railroad train was mine I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away  ",
