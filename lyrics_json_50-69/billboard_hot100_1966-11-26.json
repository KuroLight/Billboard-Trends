Don't you know just what it's like? Hurtin' someone that you're close to Have you ever loved all night, all night?  Remember what happened the last time that you said, \"Goodbye\" Remember the sayin' that once bitten now means twice shy It's no use, me cryin', there is no denyin', it's right But thinkin' has ruined the feelin' that we had to fight  Have you ever loved somebody? Don't you know just what it's like? Hurting someone that you're close to Have you ever loved all night, all night?  If you hear people talkin' now Will you laugh or cry? If you cry I'll sympathize with you If you laugh I'll die, if you laugh I'll die  Have you ever loved somebody? Don't you know just what it's like? Hurtin' someone that you're close to Have you ever loved all night, all night?  Have you ever loved somebody? Don't you know just what it's like?
