You wake up every morning, go to School every day, spend your nights on the corner just passing the time away Your life is so lonely like a child without a toy. Then a miracle-a boy. And that's Called \"glad.\" Now my mom is a good mom and she loves me with all her heart But she said I was too young to be in love and the boy and I would have to part And no matter how I ranted and raved, I screamed, I pleaded, I cried-she told me it Was not really love but only my girlish pride. And that's called \"bad.\" (Never go home anymore) SPOKEN: Now if that's happened to you, don't let this. I packed my clothes and Left home that night. Though she begged me to stay, I was sure I was right. And You know something funny?? I forgot that boy right away. Instead I remember Being tucked in bed and hearing my mama say (Hush, little baby, don't you cry) (Mama won't go away) Mama!!! (You can never go home anymore) Mama!!! I can never go home anymore SPOKEN: Do you ever get that feeling and wanna kiss and hug her? Do it now- Tell her you love her. Don't do to your mom what I did to mine. She grew so lonely In the end. Angels picked her for a friend (Never) And I can never go home (never) anymore And that's called \"sad.\"  ",
