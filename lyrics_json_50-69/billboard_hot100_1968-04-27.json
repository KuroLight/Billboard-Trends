Sweet talking Clyde would holler As Bonnie loaded dollars In the dewlap bag  Now one brave man He tried to take them alone They left him lying in a pool of blood And laughed about it all the way home  Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun  They used to laugh about dying But deep inside them they knew That pretty soon they'd be lying Beneath the ground together Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew  Acting upon reliable information A Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine A half a dozen carbines opened up on them  Bonnie and Clyde They lived a lot together And finally together They died  ",

Will he be understanding Or does he think the usual way? Maybe I shouldn't worry But I've been through this before And I'd like to get things straight Before I'm knocking on your door  Does your mama know about me? Does she know just what I am? If she says forget about me  Do you think you'd understand? And what about your friends? Do you care what people say? Will you accept the burdons I know will surely come your way? Maybe I shouldn't worry But I've been through this before And I'd like to get things straight Before I'm knocking on your door  Does your mama know about me? Does she know just what I am? Will she turn her back on me?  Or accept me as a man? We've got to stand tall Can't stumble or crawl We've got to be strong For love that's so right Can't be wrong And every day I see it grow And I don't want to let it go I guess that's why I gotta know  Does your mama know about me? Does your mama know about me? Does your mama know about me? Does your mama know about me? Does your mama know about me?  ",
