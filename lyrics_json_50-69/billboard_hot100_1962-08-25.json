Which is camel for, \"What the heck did he say anyway?\" Well....  He brought that camel to a screeching halt At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes And a bone in her nose ho, ho Spoken  There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby.\" (laughter) You know what I mean!

Go away, little girl It's hurtin' me more each minute that you delay When you are near me like this You're much too hard to resist So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay.\"  Woke up this mornin' feelin' fine There's somethin' special on my mind Last night I met a new boy in the neighbourhood, whoa yeah Somethin' tells me I'm into something good Somethin' tells me I'm into something good  Hey girl now sit yourself down I'm not ashamed to get down on the ground And then beg you to stay Don't go away, Hey Girl I beg you please don't go away Hey girl  One fine day, you'll look at me And you will know our love was meant to be One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl One fine day, oh One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl  Tonight you're mine Completely You give your love So sweetly Tonight the light Of love is in your eyes But will you love me tomorrow?  Tonight with words Unspoken You say that I'm the only one But will my heart Be broken When the night Meets the morning sun  I'd like to know That your love Is love I can Be sure of So tell me now And I won't ask again Will you still love me tomorrow? Will you still love me tomorrow?  Will you still love me tomorrow? Will you still love me tomorrow?  ",
