        "lyrics": "  Out in the West Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina Music would play and Felina would whirl  Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina Wicked and evil while casting a spell My love was deep for this Mexican maiden I was in love but in vain, I could tell  One night a wild young cowboy came in Wild as the West Texas wind Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved  So in anger I challenged his right For the love of this maiden Down went his hand for the gun that he wore My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor  Just for a moment I stood there in silence Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there I had but one chance and that was to run  Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran Out where the horses were tied I caught a good one, it looked like it could run Up on its back and away I did ride  Just as fast as I could from The West Texas town of El Paso Out to the badlands of New Mexico  Back in El Paso my life would be worthless Everything's gone in life; nothing is left It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden My love is stronger than my fear of death  I saddled up and away I did go Riding alone in the dark Maybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart  And at last here I Am on the hill overlooking El Paso I can see Rosa's cantina below My love is strong and it pushes me onward Down off the hill to Felina I go  Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys Off to my left ride a dozen or more Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me I have to make it to Rosa's back door  Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel A deep burning pain in my side Though I am trying to stay in the saddle I'm getting weary, unable to ride  But my love forFelina is strong And I rise where I've fallen Though I am weary I can't stop to rest I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle I feel the bullet go deep in my chest  From out of nowhere Felina has found me Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for One little kiss and Felina, goodbye  Songwriter:  Marty Robbins  ",

The Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, \"Soldier, put away those Cards.\" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and Brought before the Provost Marshall  The Marshall said, \"Sergeant, why have you brought this man Here?\" \"For playing cards in church, Sir.\" \"And what have you to say for Yourself, son?\" \"Much, Sir,\" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, \"I Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever Punished.\" The soldier said, \"Sir, I have been on the march for about six Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.\" And with that, the boy Started his story:  \"You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew  Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter So you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a Prayer Book.\"  \"And friends, the story is true. I know, I was that soldier.\"  ",
