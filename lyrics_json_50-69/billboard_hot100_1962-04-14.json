McMahon the Irishman was burned so badly he couldn't swim Leave me here go on he said cause if you don't we'll all be dead The PT skipper couldn't leave him a man to die alone at sea And with a strap between his teeth he towed the Irishman through the sea Smoke and fire upon the sea... [ flute ] He led his men through waters dark rocky reefs and hungry sharks He braved the enemy's bayonets a thirty eight hung round his neck Four more days and four more nights a rescue boat pulled into sight The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy and his crew lived on Now who could guess who could possibly know that same man named Kennedy Would be the leader of the nation be the one to take command The PT 109 was gone but Kennedy lived to fight again Smoke and fire upon the sea everywhere they looked was the enemy But JFK and his crew lived on Which proves it's hard to get the best of a man named John (Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John Big John)  ",

And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they swore they'ed get him but the devil got him first  Roaring out of Harlan; revving up his mill He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville With G men on his tail light; road block up ahead The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread  Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike He left the road at 90; that's all there is to say The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day  And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first  ",
