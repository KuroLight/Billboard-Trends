It isn't easy, but I'll try  If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters That would soar a thousand feet high \"To Sir, with love\"  The time has come For closing books and long last looks must end And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend  A friend who taught me right from wrong And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn What, what can I give you in return?  If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start But I would rather you let me give my heart To Sir, with love  ",
