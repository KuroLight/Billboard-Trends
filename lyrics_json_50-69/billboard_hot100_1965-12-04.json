And that's Called \"glad.\" Now my mom is a good mom and she loves me with all her heart But she said I was too young to be in love and the boy and I would have to part And no matter how I ranted and raved, I screamed, I pleaded, I cried-she told me it Was not really love but only my girlish pride.

We will live eternally in this mood of reverie Away ... from all the earthly cares around us My world was dull each minute until I found you in it And all at once the happiness I knew Became these quiet nights of loving you!
