Staggering through the thin and thick of it Hating each old, tired trick of it Know what I am, I'm good and sick of it  Where am I going? Why do I care? Run where it's foul, run where it's fair No matter where I run, I meet myself there  Looking inside me, what do I see? Anger and hope and doubt, what am I all about? And where am I going?
