(I did it all for her, my flower child) Lost in your dreams Said the ride's so long and the nights so black A thousand shadows can never look back You're flying off toward an isle of dreams And now you're lost, and lonely it seems Said there's a dreammaker in every corner JUst waitin' to weave a web of sin Said better watch yourself, little girl I said better keep away from him I said the rides so long and the night's so black A thousand shadows can never turn back CHORUS I said, run, little girl just as fast as you can Run like the wind Said, run, little girl just as fast as you can Run away from him ahhhhhhhh I lost the heart I had before And now my spirit can't cross the door Oh what can I do, I made a mistake But know I know, I know it's too late I said ah ah ahhhh I've tried so hard, now I'm lost again I didn't listen to what they say And now I'm losing, I've lost my way The road so black and the night's so dark A thousand shadows can never turn back I said ah ah ahhhh The ride, the ride, the ride's so long The night, the night, the night's so black Ah ah ah ah child child child child child -------------------------------------------------------  ",

And so is their city. This is a very personal song, so if the viewer cannot understand it, particularly those of you who are European residents, save up all your bread, and fly Trans-Love Airways to San Francisco, USA. Then, maybe, you\u2019ll understand the song. It will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song, but for the sake of your own piece of mind  Strobe light beam, creates dreams Walls move, minds do too On a warm San Franciscan night  Old child , young child Feel all right  On a warm San Franciscan night Angels sing, leather wings Jeans of blue, Harley Davidson's too On a warm San Franciscan night  Old angel, young angel Feel all right On a warm San Franciscan night  I wasn't born there Perhaps I'll die there There's no place left to go San Francisco  Cops face is filled with hate Heavens above He's on a street called \"Love\" When will they ever learn? Old cop, young cop Feel all right On a warm San Franciscan night  The children are cool They don't raise fools It's an American dream Includes Indians too  ",

Feeling low, gotta go See a show in town Hear the jokes, have a smoke And a laugh at the clown In a whirl, see a girl With a smile in her eyes Never thought I'd be brought Right down by her lies  In a trance, watch her dance To the beat of the drums Faster now, sweating brow I'm all the fingers and thumbs Wonder why I hit the sky When she blows me a kiss In a while run a mile I'm regretting all this  Chorus  Time to go, close the show Wave the people good-bye Grab my coat, grab my hat Look that girl in the eye Where's your home? What's your phone number? Stop fooling 'round Could have died, she replied \"I'm the wife of the clown.\"  Chorus  ",
