Some gal would giggle and I'd get red And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named \"Sue.\"  [Verse 3] Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean My fist got hard and my wits got keen I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame But I made a vow to the moon and stars That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars And kill that man who gave me that awful name  [Verse 4] Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July And I just hit town and my throat was dry I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew At an old saloon on a street of mud There at a table, dealing stud Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me \"Sue.\"  [Verse 5] Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye He was big and bent and gray and old And I looked at him and my blood ran cold And I said: \"My name is 'Sue!' How do you do! Now you're going to die!!\"  [Verse 6] Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes And he went down, but to my surprise He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear But I busted a chair right across his teeth And we crashed through the wall and into the street Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer  [Verse 7] I tell you, I've fought tougher men But I really can't remember when He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss He went for his gun and I pulled mine first He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile  [Verse 8] And he said: \"Son, this world is rough And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along So I give ya that name and I said goodbye I knew you'd have to get tough or die And it's the name that helped to make you strong  [Verse 9] He said: \"Now you just fought one hell of a fight And I know you hate me, and you got the right To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do But ya ought to thank me, before I die For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue  [Verse 10] I got all choked up and I threw down my gun And I called him my pa, and he called me his son And I came away with a different point of view And I think about him, now and then Every time I try and every time I win And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him Bill or George!

Get out of the way  The country needs a father Not an uncle or big brother Someone to keep the peace at home If we can't get together Look out for stormy weather Don't make me pay for your mistakes I have to pay my own  Yesterday's glory won't help us today You wanna retire? Get out of the way  I ain't got much time The young ones close behind I can't wait in line  If we can not wake you Then we'll have to shake you Though some say you'll only understand a gun Got to prove them wrong Or you will lose the battle Don't you know we'll start a war Which will be won by none  Yesterday's glory won't help us today You wanna retire? Get out of the way  I ain't got much time The young ones close behind I can't wait in line  Move over Come on, Move Over  Repeat Chorus  ",

What's the use in breakin' up When you just turn around and make up?

Oh, yeah Now everybody, everybody's got it's own thing Everybody's got it's way of doing a thing Now we should attempt to do a tune that is very popular It was written by one of the great young songwriters of today Now, I don't know what he was thinking about or what inspired him to write this tune, but it's a deep tune There's a deep meaning to this tune, because it shows you what the power of love can do Now I should attempt to do it my way, my own interpretation of it Like I said, everybody's got it's own thing I'm gonna bring it on down to Soulsville Now I want you to bear along with me for a few minutes while I set it up Now I want your imagination I want you to travel with me Oh, come on, come on, come on  This young man was raised in the hills of Tennessee When he reached the age of maturity, he moved to the West Coast And he fell in love when he got out there to this young girl Aw, man, she was out of sight. She was bad And then they started dating and then the inevitable: became engaged and got married Mmmmmmm, hmmmmmm, hmmmm They were happily married. That's right they lived in L.A Aw, aw. The power of love was upon them But you see, girls, I don't mean to come down on you But this man loved this woman so...He can really say love is blind He can see no wrong. No, no, no He worked every day and sometimes he'd pull overtime, double time, triple time He bought everything this woman's heart desires Everything that he could wreak and streak He spent his last dime on women because he loved her And you know, girls, you can take love and kindness sometime for weakness, and she took it for granted She said, \"I got a fool and I know I got a fool, but I got a good thing.\" Yeah, she was standing on the corner, you understand, meeting with her friends She would go to the beauty salon, get her hair fixed She'd go shopping and she would brag about her good thing she's got Yeah. And she took doubt on it See, ain't nobody gonna believe what to tell him no way, fool Aw, yeah, girls, you would love that sometimes But one day, one day, the old boy got sick and he had to come home I don't have to tell you what he found Oh, yeah, it hurt him so bad He said, \"Baby...Mama, why?\" That's all he could say That's all he could say. He was hurt But she said, \"Aw. Go on fool, you're doing it, but the man wasn't doing it, but that's the only excuse you can give him.\" He said, \"Mama, I can't take it. I got to leave you. I'm gonna leave you.\" He packed his rags, you understand, and started out the door And when he reached the driveway, you understand, he went there begging just like Tyrone Davis And he said, \"Oh, Mama, Mama, Mama, can I change, oh, my mind.\" You see, the power of love was upon him and then he came back. Oh, yes he did When she tried to straighten up, she said she was gonna straighten up She got a little job to help him out with the bills too, but that was just a sham, because he found it again and again, and seven times he left this woman and seven times he came back Aw, but you know, the heart can take so much That's right. You can kick a dog around for so long and he'll get tired. He'll turn And he taken all that he could stand In the eighth time that this went down, he said, \"Mama, I got to go.\" With tears in his eyes, he said, \"I'm gonna leave you, baby.\" He said, \"I ain't coming back.\" He said, \"I'm leaving my heart right here, but I got to go, you see, cause this man can't take no more.\" She didn't believe it He packed his clothes He got in his 1965 Ford and started out Three times he started to turn back before he reached the outskirts of the city, but he kept on going Oh, I don't wanna go, but I got to leave you, Mama And he's going down on the highway I guess it was around 3:30 in the morning He could not hardly see the road with tears in his eyes That's right, he was crying They were meeting in his tears He could not hardly see the sign that went on the sign of the road It read the next town is 125 miles away And these very words came into his mind. He said...  By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising Oh, she'll find a note I left hanging on the door She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving. Oh, yes she will. Why? Cause I left that girl so many times before. Oh  By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working And she'll probably stop at lunch just to give her, her sweet good thing a call And ohhh, she'll hear, oh, oh, the phone keeps right on ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing, oh, and ringing off the wall. Mama, Mama, that's all  And by the time I get to Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping She'll turn softly in her restless sleep, call my name out low And ohhhh, then she'll cry just to think I-I-I-I-I-I would really leave her But time after time after time and time and again I tried to tell her so But she wasn't a believer, oh, and she did know Oh, that I-I-I-I-I would really go She didn't believe I would really go. Oh no I hate to leave you, baby. Yes I do I really, really, really hate to go Oh yeah, but this heart of mine just can't take no more I-I-I-I-I-I-I've taken all that I could stand You should've known what you were doing to the man Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You see, when I left, baby, I left a good piece of my heart. Oh, yeah You know, you know, you know, you know you took, baby You know you...You know you took the greatest part. Oh, yeah I don't know how I'm gonna make it, oh no, but I got to go on I'm gonna miss all the sweet loving and the good times But the good times weren't as heavy, aw, as the bad times. Oh, yeah You really, really put the hurt on me. Yes you did I'm a prisoner of your love and I just--I just won't ever be free, oh no So it's bye-bye. Oh, Mama, Mama, bye-bye Oh, bye-bye. Oh, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye It's too late for you to cry You had a good thing, oh, and you abused it. Yes you did. Yes you did You had a good heart, oh, and you misused it. Oh, yeah You were sweet to me, yes you were But on the other hand, you were real cold, cold, cold, cold You just kept me, oh You kept me hanging on. Yes you did Oh, oh, you kept me hanging on You kept me begging, begging You kept me begging to do right You kept me pacing the floor at night. Oh yeah But I love you. God knows that I love you, baby Ahh, yeah. I'll always love you, yeah  (Instrumental break)  Raindrops of water meeting under my chin You can look at me and tell all the pain I'm in Aw, yeah.
