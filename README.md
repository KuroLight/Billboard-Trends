## N parts are planned to do:

1. A powerful Spider-man gets lyrics.json, including artists, titles, lyrics, genres, etc.
2. A smart Iron-man does the data analysis job.
3. A muscular Captain-America shows the beautiful charts.
4. Last but not the least, a magical Dr. Strange contributes the magic.
