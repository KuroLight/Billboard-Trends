You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?  Oh, no, not I, I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive I've got my life to live, and I've got all my love to give And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive  It took all my strength not to fall apart Trying with all my mind to mend  my broken heart I spent,  so many nights feeling sorry for myself Oh, I used to cry but now I hold my head up high  And you see me, somebody new Not that lonely little person still in love with you Now you come dropping in  expecting me to be free Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me  Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now You're not welcome anymore You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?  Oh, no, not I, I will survive Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive I've got  my life to live, and all my love to give And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now You're not welcome anymore You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true...
