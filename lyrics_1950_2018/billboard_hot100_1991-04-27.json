Oh no, this can not be accepted The feelings that belong to you must be protected Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister  [Chorus] It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam In full glory reflected now shines on the stream 'Tis the star-spangled banner! O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a country should leave us no more Their blood has wiped out their foul footstep's pollution No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved homes and the war's desolation Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just And this be our motto: \"In God is our trust\" And the star-spangled banner forever shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave  ",

Well shit gets hot Pregnant teens, children's screams Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam You don't come here much, and ya better not Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot I gotta get more money than you got So what, if some muthafucka gets shot? That's how the game is played Another brother slayed, the wound is deep But they're givin us a band aid My education's low but I got long dough I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro Sleep on silk, lie like a politician My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe There'll be another one after me!

        "lyrics": "  [Verse 1] I looked out across the river today Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light Two priests on the ferry October geese on a cold winter's night  [Chorus] All this time the river flowed Endlessly to the sea  [Verse 2] Two priests came 'round our house tonight One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows  [Chorus]  If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man I'd bury him at sea  [Verse 3] Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?  All this time the river flowed Endlessly like a silent tear All this time the river flowed Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?  [Bridge] Teachers told the Romans built this place They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town They lived and they died They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left Were the stones the workmen found  [Outro] All this time the river flowed In the falling light of a Northern sun If I had my way, take a boat from the river Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one One by one  ",
