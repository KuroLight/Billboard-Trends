Don't you?  [Verse 2] You had me several years ago When I was still quite naive Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair And that you would never leave But you gave away the things you loved And one of them was me I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee Clouds in my coffee, and  [Chorus] You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain I'll bet you think this song is about you Don't you? Don't you? I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee Clouds in my coffee, and You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain I'll bet you think this song is about you Don't you? Don't you?  [Verse 3] Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga And your horse naturally won Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia To see the total eclipse of the sun Well, you're where you should be all the time And when you're not, you're with Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend Wife of a close friend, and  [Chorus] You're so vain You probably think this song is about you You're so vain I'll bet you think this song is about you Don't you?
