Cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this: \"Dance... dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look In the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a Woman gotta find a woman\". He'd go down to the lake where all the Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look Around and just reach in and grab one. \"Come here... come here\" He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there Wet and frightened. He said: \"Move... move\". She got up. She was a Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said: \"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!\". She looked down on him She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said (Falsetto): \"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". He said: \"Wha?\". She said (falsetto): \"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". You know what he said? He started it way Back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto) \"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\" he said \"Right on! Right on! Hotpants! Hotpants! Ugh... ugh... ugh\"  ",

I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots.\"  Took a corner; sideswiped a truck Crossed my fingers just for luck My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts The guy beside me was white as a ghost  Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?  We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension. Man! What a ride! I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!\"  ",

I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  [Bridge 1] It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?  [Classical guitar solo]  Alone again, naturally  [Verse 3] Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears  And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand, why the only man She had ever loved had been taken  Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken  And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally  ",

        "lyrics": "  In the morning when you start your day, do you feel yourself quite lost? In a world of countless millions, on the tide of your life you're tossed Don't think you're getting nowhere, you know we all must start From very small beginnings, off to a better part  In the rush and hustle of your day, when all of your world seems mad Do you look at everything you see, and know that it's not so bad? Just take your time and work it out, you know what's in your mind From very small beginnings, off to a better time  Take your time and work it out, then maybe you'll see You're not wasting your time going 'round Just acting a play, you're finding your way You're making it pay, you're making today  In the darkness of a brand new day, when everything's hushed and still Can you look at everything you see, and know that it's all worthwhile? The dark of night is fading, back creeping up's the sun It starts from small beginnings, full spreads to everyone  Take your time and work it out, then maybe you'll see You're not wasting your time going 'round Just acting a play, you're finding your way You're making it pay, you're making today  In the darkness of a brand new day, when everything's hushed and still You can look around at everything you see, and know that it's all worthwhile? The dark of night is fading, back creeping up's the sun It starts from small beginnings, full spreads to everyone  In the morning when you start your day In the morning when you start your day In the morning when you start your day  In the morning when you start your day, do you feel yourself quite lost? In a world of countless millions, on the tide of your life you're tossed Don't think you're getting nowhere, you know we all must start From very small beginnings, off to a better part  Do, do, do, do do do Do, do, do, do do do Do, do, do, do do do Do, do, do  ",
