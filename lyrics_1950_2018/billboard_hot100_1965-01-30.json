How to tell you I'm not free? How can I bear to see your heart break To see your heart break over me  Amore scusami se sto piangendo Amore scusami, ma ho capito che lasciandoti io soffriro  Amore baciami, arrivederci amore baciami E se mi penserai ricordati che amo te  Ti ricordi quella sera che per gioco ti bacia? Sembrava solo un'avventura, un'avventura in riva al mar Ti baciavo nel silenzio, non volevo confessar Che stavo forse a poco a poco innamorandomi di te  My love, forgive me  I didn't mean to have it end like this I didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me  My love, please kiss me Arrivederci amore, kiss me Though we're apart, you'll still be in my heart I love so, I love so, I love so  ",

Some mush-head on a motorcycle heading right at us And I knew at last me and my baby were about to meet The Leader of the Pack  Well when I come to I looked around And there was the Leader And there was the Pack And over there was my baby And over there was my baby And way over there was my baby  I want my baby back Got to have my baby back I miss her oh so much Can't live without her touch  It's been many months now since that fateful night And you know something, I've tried Believe me I have tried But I just can't make it without my Baby So I've decided I'm going to have back One way or another Oh Baby, I dig you so much Hot dang. Pay dirt  I got my Baby back Now I got my Baby back I love her oh so much Can't live without her touch I got my Baby back  ",
