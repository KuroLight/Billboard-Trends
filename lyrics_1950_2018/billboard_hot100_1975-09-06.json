I think she does Like the stars above me, I know because When the sky is bright Everything's alright  [Verse 2] Flying me back to Memphis Honey, keep the oven warm All the clouds are clearing And I think we're over the storm Well I've been picking it up around me Daisy I think I'm sane But I'm awful glad And I guess you're really to blame, blame  [Bridge] Do you really love me? I hope you do Like the stars above me, how I love you When it's cold at night Everything's alright  [Hook]  ",

Having all this money Is going to bring me down If you ain't with me honey To help me spread it around!  I could get myself a nose job I could diet for a year But I'll never be Robert Redford Cause I'm much to fond of beer Please don't misunderstand me It's not love I'm trying to buy It's just I got all this here money And I'm a pretty ugly guy  And I got more money Then a horse has hairs Cause my rich old uncle died And answered all my prayers! Having all this money Is going to bring me down If you ain't with me honey To help me spread it around!  I don't mind if you love me for my money If you love me for whatever else I got But 'cept for all this stuff I'm a lonely Fort Knox I don't guess I'm doing all that hot  And I got more money Then a horse has hairs Cause my rich old uncle died And answered all my prayers!
