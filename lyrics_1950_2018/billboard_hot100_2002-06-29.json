[Verse 1] All I need is one mic, one beat, one stage One nigga front, my face on the front page Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib One God to show me how to do things his son did Pure, like a cup of virgin blood Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us Police watch us {*siren*} , roll up and try knockin' us One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up? But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in Blackin' out as I shoot back \u2013 fuck gettin' hit! {*more sirens*} This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it 'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb We need more warriors soon Sent from the stars, sun and the moon In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH 9's OUT THIS IS WHAT NAS IS 'BOUT, NIGGA, THE TIME IS NOW!

I feel it in my gut THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW, MY NIGGA, THE TIME IS NOW!  [Chorus] All I need is one mic..

Fooled you niggas What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin' War gets deep, some beef is everlastin' Complete with thick scars Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards Drama, where does it start? You know the block was ill as a youngster Every night it was like a, cop'll get killed Body found in the dumpster For real a hustler, purchased my Range Niggas throwin' dirt on my name Jealous \u2018cause fiends got they work and complain Bitches left me \u2018cause they thought I was finished Shoulda knew she wasn't true She came to me when her man caught a sentence Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes Movin' with a change of pace Lighter load, see now the king is straight Swellin' my melon, \u2018cause none of these niggas real Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal? This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found You need some soul-searchin', the time is now  [Chorus] All I need is one mic.. (yeah, yeah yeah yeah) All I need is one mic..

I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer  [Verse 2] Help me carry on, assure me it's ok to Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness Will the ending be ever coming suddenly? Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?  [Chorus] Show me what it's for, make me understand it I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer Is there something more than what I've been handed? I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer  [Rap] So when and how will I know?  [Bridge] How much further do I have to go? And how much longer till I finally know? `Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me In front of me  [Chorus] Show me what it's for, make me understand it I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer Is there something more than what I've been handed? I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer  ",
