And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face? And will you never try to reach me? It is I that wanted space  [Hook] Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what\u2019s good for you  [Verse 2] I\u2019m sober now for 3 whole months It\u2019s one accomplishment that you helped me with The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won\u2019t touch again In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take So I\u2019ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind  [Hook]  [Bridge] And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made And like a baby boy, I never was a man Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand And then I fell down yelling, \u201cMake it go away!\u201d Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be And then she whispered \u201cHow can you do this to me?\u201d  [Hook] For you For you For you  [Girls Singing] If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?

He never really talks much Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps  Put it together himself, now the picture connects Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist  [Verse 3: Ryu] This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method \"Name of the Game\"  Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church I like \"Bleach\", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse This dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot  [Chorus] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  [Verse 4: Ryu] They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spittin' fire with Mike Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak What a fucking nihilist, porcupine--he's a prick, he's a cock The type woman want to be with and rappers hope he get shot  Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat  [Verse 5: Tak] Tak, he's not your everyday on the block He knows how to work with what he's got Making his way to the top He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him \"Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?\"  No, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they doing, give a hundred percent  [Verse 6: Mike Shinoda] Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind  It's like a design is written in his head, every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed? Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

Scratch your scalp When you take out your braids? Does she know that you like too Play PS2 till 6 in the morning Like I do?

(before we play) Show up on my doorstep? (with a bouquet) Does he call me in the middle of the day just to say, \"Hey, baby, I love you\"?
