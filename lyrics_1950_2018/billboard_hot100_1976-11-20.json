The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound When the wave broke over the railing And every man knew, as the captain did too 'Twas the witch of November come stealin' The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait When the gales of November came slashin' When afternoon came it was freezing rain In the face of a hurricane west wind  When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck Sayin' \"Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya\" At seven p.m. a main hatchway caved in He said, \"Fellas, it's been good to know ya\" The captain wired in he had water comin' in And the good ship and crew was in peril And later that night when his lights went out of sight Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald  Does anyone know where the love of God goes When the waves turn the minutes to hours The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her They might have split up or they might have capsized They may have broke deep and took water And all that remains is the faces and the names Of the wives and the sons and the daughters  Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings In the rooms of her ice-water mansion Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams The islands and bays are for sportsmen And farther below, Lake Ontario Takes in what Lake Erie can send her And the iron boats go as the mariners all know With the gales of November remembered  In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed In the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down Of the big lake they call Gitche Gumee Superior, they said, never gives up her dead When the gales of November come early  ",

Oh, my darling How a love so right Can turn out to be so wrong?  Where did she go When I need her close to me? And the perfect story ended at the start I thought you came forever And you came to break my heart Now I'm hanging on On the chance that you'll come back to me Oh, my love  [Chorus] How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong? Oh, my darling How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong? Oh, my darling  [Bridge] I could take it in my stride Start living for the moment Maybe half the things we sought were never there Simply open up our eyes And break it down to size It isn't really fair  [Chorus] How a love so right Can turn out to be so wrong?

Well I'll be over you  You're out tonight with your new love I'm far far from your mind Trying to get over you love chould take a whole lifetime I can't believe you could want anybody else so no one could take my place At least that's what I keep telling myself as the tears fall down my face Got nine million nine hundred... I'll be over you Got nine million nine hundred... Got nine million nine hundred...  ",
