Her schemes and plans 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice (Don't think twice) Do think twice! (hoo)  [4th Verse] She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no) 'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby  [Bridge] People always told me, \"Be careful of what you do And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts\" She came and stood right by me Then the smell of sweet perfume This happened much too soon She called me to her room  [Chorus] Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son Billie Jean is not my lover She's just a girl who claims that I am the one But the kid is not my son She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son She says I am the one She says she is the one She says I am the one  [Outro] Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover Billie Jean is not my lover  ",
