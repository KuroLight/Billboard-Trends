Always claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch It don\u2019t make sense, either you\u2019re a soldier from the start Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the part\u2014like that!  [Hook] It\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) It\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)  [Verse 2] See, I don\u2019t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet So my composure is kept while others start to sweat Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck And that\u2019s deep; how deep? It\u2019s deeper than Atlantis Home of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles Dangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted Now, how the fuck is you hard Not being scared by the boulevard? I'm pullin' that card, and saying \"Gin, mothafucka!\" Flowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka! I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test It\u2019s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi  [Hook] It\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!) It\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)  [Verse 3] Niggas smoke stress and cross dress, but I just play the back Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract Real tightly rolled, fuck \u2019em all how I feel I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal Therefore you look and stare like it\u2019s magic But too much of anything can make you an addict Whenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate But wait! Who dares to cross this path? Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with Smokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit He-he, and keep it all in perspective Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi Once again, it's the Likwidation crew And we return at you like this  [Hook] It\u2019s a shame, niggas in the rap game Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
