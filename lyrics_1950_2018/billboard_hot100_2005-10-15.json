You guessed it - you are not pimpin If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy That's why it's three dollars a glass \"Put your hands down\" Now look down, look down I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks NOT PIMPIN!
