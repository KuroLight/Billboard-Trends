Sweet talking Clyde would holler As Bonnie loaded dollars In the dewlap bag  Now one brave man He tried to take them alone They left him lying in a pool of blood And laughed about it all the way home  Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun  They used to laugh about dying But deep inside them they knew That pretty soon they'd be lying Beneath the ground together Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew  Acting upon reliable information A Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine A half a dozen carbines opened up on them  Bonnie and Clyde They lived a lot together And finally together They died  ",

Please let me talk to you  I just want to know about The rooms behind your minds Do I see a vacuum there, or am I going blind? Or is it just remains from vibrations and echoes Long ago Things like \"Love the World\" and \"Let your fancy Flow\" Is this true? Please let me talk to you Let me talk to you  I have lived here before, the days of ice And of course this is why I'm so concerned And I come back to find the stars misplaced And the smell of a world that has burned The smell of a world that has burned  [Bridge] Well, maybe, maybe it's just a change of climate I can dig it, I can dig it baby, I just want to see  [Outro] So where do I purchase my ticket? I would just like to have a ringside seat I want to know about the new Mother Earth I want to hear and see everything I want to hear and see everything I want to hear and see everything Aw, shucks If my daddy could see me now  ",
