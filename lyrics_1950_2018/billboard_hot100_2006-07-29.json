And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face? And will you never try to reach me?

Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change (Every time I hear your name.) In my heart I know you're gone, but in my head  I feel rain fallin' right out of the blue sky An' it's the fifth of May, an' I'm right there starin' in your eyes That's all it takes, an' I'm in that place An' there we are, a point down by the riverside An' I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time An' I can't explain, but I'm in that place Every time I hear your name Every time I hear your name (Every time I hear your name.)

Deliverance of my heart! Please strike! Be deliberate!  [Chorus] Wait, I'm coming undone! Irate, I'm coming undone! Too late, I'm coming undone! What looks so strong, so delicate! Wait, I'm starting to suffocate! And soon I anticipate! I'm coming undone! What looks so strong, so delicate!

Trigger between my eyes! Please strike! Make it quick now!  [Chorus] Wait, I'm coming undone! Irate, I'm coming undone! Too late, I'm coming undone! What looks so strong, so delicate!
