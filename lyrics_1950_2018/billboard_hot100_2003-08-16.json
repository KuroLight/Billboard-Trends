People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world's addicted to the drama Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate Madness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all  [Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake] People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin' Will you practice what you preach?

If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong? With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug If you never know truth, then you never know love Where's the love, y'all?

Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found Now ask yourself\u2026  [Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake] Where is the love?

Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  [Verse 2] If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed? If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head? If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?  [Pre-Chorus] I don't know why you're so far away But I know that this much is true We'll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you're the one I build my home with I hope, I love you all my life  [Chorus] I don't wanna to run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
