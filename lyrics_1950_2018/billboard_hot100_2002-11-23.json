[Verse 1] His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already\u2014Mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, time's up, over\u2014blaow! Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it He knows, his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Verse 2] His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking, make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring, but superstardom's Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads, God only Knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner But the beat goes on\u2014da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Verse 3] No more games, I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed I've been chewed up, and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to- five, and I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me To wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me To the point I'm like a snail, I've got To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option\u2014failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Outro] You can do anything you set your mind to, man  ",

I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet  [Verse 2] I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch \u2018Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun \u2018Cause I'da killed him, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show  [Hook] I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!) I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet  [Verse 3] Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin' But put yourself in my position, just try to envision Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin', goin' through public housing systems Victim of M\u00fcnchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma? But guess what, you're gettin' older now And it's cold when you're lonely, and Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her\u2014she won't even be at your funeral! See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get? You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit! Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what, I am dead\u2014dead to you as can be!  [Hook] I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
