Whistling in the graveyard Calling up your girlfriend Just trying to make her understand You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand No question (so many questions) She's going to catch you out, boy It all seems so underhand Now she's the only thing that ever made You feel like a man, man, madman, madman  Tenderness Where is the Tenderness Tenderness Tenderness Where is it?
