I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots\"  Smoke was rollin' out in the back When I started gainin' on that Cadillac I knew I could catch him, and hoped I could pass But when I did, I'd be short on gas  Went around a corner with the tires in the side You could feel the tension, man what a ride I said, \"Hold on, I've got a license to fly\" And a Cadillac pulled over and let me by  And all of a sudden a rod started knockin' When down in the dips, and she started to rockin' I look in my mirror, and a red light was blinkin' Cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln  Well they arrested me and put me in jail And called my pop to throw my bail He said, \"Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin' You don't quit drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln!\"  ",
