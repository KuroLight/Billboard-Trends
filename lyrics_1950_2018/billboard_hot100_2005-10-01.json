I gotta do this for me Cuz if I dont I'll probably regret it But if I do I'll probably regret it How do I cope?  CHORUS: How do you cope when The one you love is with somebody else And theres nothin you can do about it How do you deal with The fact that you had a chance But you chose to turn away for your career I gotta take it though its heart-breakin' Its somethin that I had to do But nobody said that it would hurt so bad So how do I live.. How do I deal without you  2nd Verse: Its killing me to know That your heart's with me But you're with him cuz I chose to be In this industry Money, shows and hoes come along with Luxury and pain Is all you see when you think about it But this is the life That I was given So i have to live it to the fullest But how do I deal in the meantime Without you  [Chorus] SOLO: How do you deal when You can't be with the one you love And the one that you love is with somebody else (I don't know, I don't know) And what do you do When you know she don't love him And she loves me but she just can't stand loving you far away (I guess I'm gonna have to just) You just deal with it, deal with it (I don't want to have to live with it) You just deal with it, deal with it (no, no, no) You just deal with it, deal with it (I don't want nobody else loving you) You just deal with it, deal with it (I don't want nobody else loving me)  [Chorus 2X]  ",
