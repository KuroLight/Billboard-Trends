Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers I ain't never run into no Martian Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat  Well, he was sitting over there with a Bunch of colored sticks on his plate And I looked over at him and I said \"What you eating there, boy, crayons?\" He said, \"Why no! They're Martian cigarettes! Here, try one!\"  Well, 'bout half hour later He looked over at me and smiled Them ol' Martians ain't got But two teeth in their head And he said, \"How do you feel?\"  And I said, \"Weeeeeeell, I feel so good Yeah, I do, gonna boogie Wow! Til the break of day!\"  Meanwhile, back at Eat's I was stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill thinking, I said \"How come out of all the places You could have landed You ended up here?\"  He said, \"Well, according To my lunar space map This town here is supposed to be The boogie capital of the U.S.A!\"  So I asked him, I said \"Now, where else you been, boy?\" And he told me  He said, \"I've rocked 'em over And I've rocked 'em down Rocked 'em in the country I've rocked 'em in town Rock 'n' roll, Memphis on up to Maine Woke up a lady and she asked my name! Told her the name was on ten of my shirts Told her, rocking chair Martian Don't have to work!\"  Yeah, I feel so good Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie Martian boogie  ",
