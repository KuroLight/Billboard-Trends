Did you do it for money? Did you do it for spite? Did you think you had to, honey?  [Chorus 3] Who is gonna make it? We'll find out in the long run (In the long run) I know we can take it If our love is a strong one (Is a strong one)  [Pre-Chorus 4] Well, we're scared, but we ain't shaking Kinda bent, but we ain't breaking  [Chorus 4] In the long run Ooh, I want to tell you, it's a long run In the long run In the long run  [Outro] Gonna find out, ooh fa-fa-fa-find out Long-long-long-long, long-long-long-long Ooh, run-run-run, baby, run-run, baby Long, long, long, long  ",
