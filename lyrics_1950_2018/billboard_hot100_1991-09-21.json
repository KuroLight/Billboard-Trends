Better yet stomp her Break out the 12-gauge and full of buckshot, pump her But I said, nah forget it, I'm a chill This girl need help, she's mentally ill She got to trip' and started spending my grip! So I just had to rip the pipe out' her lips She cried, \"Crawf, please gimme some money\" \"I promise I'll stop, please, come on Crawf honey!\" I felt sorry for the girl cuz she's being misused It was the crack and the devil, riding to abuse This relationship just ain't gonna last Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it But let me tell you one thing I'm not I'm not your [puppet]...
