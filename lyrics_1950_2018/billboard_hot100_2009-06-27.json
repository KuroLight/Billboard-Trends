        "lyrics": "  [Verse 1] Suppose I called you up tonight And told you that I love you And suppose I said I wanna come back home And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson And I'm tired of spending all my time alone If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted And it's killing me to be so far away Would you tell me that you love me too And would we cry together Or would you simply laugh at me and say  [Chorus] I told you so Oh, I told you so I told you some day you'd come crawling back And asking me to take you in I told you so But you had to go Now I've found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again  [Verse 2] If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever Would you get down on yours too and take my hand Would we get that old time feeling Would we laugh and talk for hours The way we did when our love first began Would you tell me that you've missed me too And that you've been so lonely And you've waited for the day that I returned And we'd live and love forever And that I'm your one and only Or would you say the tables finally turned  [Chorus] Would you say I told you so Oh, I told you so I told you some day you'd come crawling back And asking me to take you in I told you so But you had to go Now I found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again  [Outro] Now I found somebody new And you will never break my heart in two again  ",
