Is he picking you up after school today? -M-m -By the way, where'd you meet him?  [Verse 1] I met him at the candy store He turned around and smiled at me You get the picture? -Yes, we see That's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack  My folks were always putting him down -Down, down They said he came from the wrong side of town -What you mean when you say that he came from the wrong side of town? They told me he was bad But I knew he was sad That's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack  One day my Dad said, \"Find someone new\" I had to tell my Jimmy, We're through -What you mean when you say that you better go find somebody new? He stood there and asked me why But all I could do was cry I'm sorry I hurt you, Leader of the Pack  He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye The tears were beginning to show As he drove away on that rainy night I begged him to go slow Whether he heard I'll never know  No, no, no, no, no, no, no Look out, look out, look out, look out  I felt so helpless, what could I do? Remembering all the things we'd been through In school they all stop and stare I can't hide the tears, but I don't care I'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack  Leader of the Pack, now he's gone  ",
