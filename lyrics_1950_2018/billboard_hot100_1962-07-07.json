You know, and they'd been carrying on for some time now behind the Sultan's back and you could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert air and he'd say (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"stop, Clyde!\" and Clyde would say, (imitate camel voice). Which is camel for, \"What the heck did he say anyway?\" Well....  He brought that camel to a screeching halt At the rear of Fatima's tent jumped off Clyde Snuck around the corner and into the tent he went There he saw Fatima laying on a Zebra skin rug Wearing rings on her fingers and bells on her toes And a bone in her nose ho, ho Spoken  There she was friends lying there in all her radiant beauty. Eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate, bowl of chitterlings, two bananas, three Hershey bars, sipping on a \"R C\" Co-Cola listening to her transistor, watching the Grand Ole Opry on the tube reading the Mad magazine while she sung, \"Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?\" and Ahab walked up to her and he said, (imitate Arabian speech) which is arabic for, \"Let's twist again like we did last summer, baby.\" (laughter) You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug, give him one of the sly looks, she said, (coy, girlish laugh) \"Crazy baby\" 'Round and around and around and around...etc  And that's the story 'bout Ahab the Arab The Sheik of the Burnin' sand Ahab the Arab The swinging Sheik of the burnin' sand  ",

And if the way I hold you Can't compare to his caress No words of consolation Will make me miss you less!  My darling, if this is goodbye Oh, I just know I'm gonna cry \u2013 So run to him Before you start crying too!
