(The sky... tonight) It's no secret at all  Love, we shine like a burning star We're falling from the sky tonight  [Chorus 2] A man will rise (Love, we shine like a) A man will fall (Burning star) From the sheer face of love (We're falling from) Like a fly from a wall. (The sky... tonight) It's no secret at all  It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky The universe exploding 'cos-a one man's lie Look I gotta go, yeah, I'm running outta change; There's a lot of things if I could I'd rearrange  ",

There's a whole other life Waiting to be lived when One day we're brave enough To talk with conviction of the heart  And down your streets I've walked alone As if my feet were not my own Such is the path I chose Doors I have opened and closed  I'm tired of living this life Fooling myself, believing we're right when I've never given love With any conviction of the heart  One with the earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe we'll survive If we only try  How long must we all wait to change This world bound in chains that we live in To know what it is to forgive and be forgiven?  Too many years of taking now Isn't it time to stop somehow? Air that's too angry to breathe Water our children can't drink  You've heard it Hundreds of times You say you're aware Believe, and you care But do you care enough Where's your conviction of the heart?  One with the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  With the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  One Earth One sky Only one world  Only one chance For one life When will live (With conviction of the heart)  One child One dream And only one life  Give her one chance For one life When will we live  Only one Earth Only one sky Only one world We've only got one chance To live in one life  I believe it's only gonna start When we begin with Some conviction of the heart  ",
