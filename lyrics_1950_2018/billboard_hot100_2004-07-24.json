You got a phone Pick it up, call me  [Hook: Eminem] How come we don't even talk no more, and you don't even call no more We don't barely keep in touch at all, and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now After all the years we've been down Ain't no way, no how, this bullshit can't be true We family, ain't a damn thing changed unless it's you  [Verse 1: Eminem] We were so young so full of life and vibrance Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit When Ronnie died you was right by my side With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it You even had the same type of childhood I did Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it We grew up, grew apart as time went by us And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it  [Hook: Eminem]  [Verse 2: Kon Artis] It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse On my own album with a deal but shit got worse 'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk Like y'all was husband and wife or something But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you  [Hook: Eminem]  [Verse 3: Proof] It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block And homies in the hood only see me on the tube So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen But Proof is just acting out the part he was thrown Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise (HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite? (AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life? And every time I go to hear you play, you look away We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face  [Hook: Eminem]  ",

Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know Am I under arrest or should I guess some more? \"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54 License and registration and step out of the car Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.\" I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit \"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?\" Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that \"Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something? Somebody important or something?\" Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit Enough that you won't illegally search my shit \"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!\" I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one \u2013 hit me!

[Chorus] I'd sure hate to break down here Nothing up ahead or in the rearview mirror Out in the middle of nowhere, knowin' I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin' So God help me, keep me moving somehow Don't let me start wishing I was with him now I made it this far without crying a single tear I'd sure hate to break down It's too late to turn around I'd sure hate to break down here  [Outro] Mile marker 215  ",
