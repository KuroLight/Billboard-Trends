Lee\" Now I don't mind 'em chopping wood And I don't care if the money's no good Just take what you need and leave the rest But they should never have taken the very best The night they drove old Dixie down And all the bells were ringin' The night they drove old Dixie down And all the people were singin' They went, \"Na, na, na\" Like my father before me, I'm a working man And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand But he was just 18, proud and brave But a yankee laid him in his grave I swear by the blood below my feet You can't raise the Caine back up when he's in defeat The night they drove old Dixie down And all the bells were ringin' The night they drove old Dixie down And all the people were singin' They went, \"Na, na, na\"  ",

[Chorus:] Spill the wine; take that pearl Spill the wine; take that pearl Spill the wine; take that pearl Spill the wine; take that pearl  [End Chorus] I thought to myself What could this mean? Am I going crazy Or is it just a dream?  Now wait a minute...  I know I'm lying In a field of grass somewhere It was all in my head But then I heard Somebody say...  [Repeat Chorus] I could feel hot flames Of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared But soon she returned  In her hand was a bottle of wine And in the other, a glass Good god  She poured some of that wine From the bottle into the glass And she raised it to her lip And before she drank it, she said...  [Repeat Chorus] Spill, spill, spill that wine Come on, take that pearl Come on and spill that wine Come on and take that pearl  Spill that wine!  [Repeat Chorus] Spill, spill, spill... Spill, spill, spill that wine Come on and spill that wine Come on, take that pearl Come on and spill that wine  [Repeat Chorus] Come on and spill that wine Take that pearl Come on spill that wine Take that pearl  [Repeat Chorus] Come on and spill it... Come on and spill it...  ",
