Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, \"You rock so naturally\" I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real I'm Cozmo D from outer space I came to rock the human race I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong That's why the whole world is singin' this song  (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it As day turns to night and night turns to day Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it Jam all around and upside down Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound  [Chilly B] (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control With the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it Get outta your seat and jam to the beat And don't you dare stop till early mornin'  Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it  (Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo) (You rocked it, that's the way you do it) (Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner) (And he started doin' this) (Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki) (Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)  (Ah, man, this is too funky for me) (I'm goin' home) (Hey, Mergatroid, let's go) (Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid?)
