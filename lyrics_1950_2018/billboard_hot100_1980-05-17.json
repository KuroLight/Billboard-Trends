Don't let it slip from view  The horizon's awaiting Your river is fading  So keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on But for tonight Just keep the fire burning bright  I will never need to ask What have I done? Comes a moment when it's clear There's only one Oh, whatever you need of me I've made up my mind I give you more than you've asked for  There are those who can foresee Where we will go All the future I don't really want to know Only that you'll be here with me  While the embers still glow We'll be safe till tomorrow  Keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on For tonight Just keep the fire burning bright  Keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on For tonight Just keep the fire burning  (Keep the fire bright) Who are you?
