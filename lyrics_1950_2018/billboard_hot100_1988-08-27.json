Toss and turn me and then disappear  Here On the edge of obsession I turn off all the lights and pray That this fantasy can be real  Night and day I want to kiss her lips And caress her like a man should do She's become the center of my emotions And I can't fight through  [Chorus:] She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my life  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  [Verse 2:] I I can almost taste her And smell the scent of her perfume I wish she were here for me to lay next to  She's so very close But like every illusion That's just how it appears  I reach out to touch And find out there's no one there Right now I'm going to close my eyes And go back to where I need to be  Maybe then I'll get to hear her say She loves me And will never leave  [Chorus:] She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my life  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right Smack dib in the middle of my mind  [Bridge:] Night and day I want to kiss her lips And caress her like a man should do She's become the center of my emotions And I can't fight through  [Chorus:] She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right Smack dib in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind  She's on the left She's on the right She's in the middle of my mind Girl's in the middle of my life  ",
