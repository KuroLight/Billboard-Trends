[Verse 1] Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you? And I refuse to let you play me for a fool You said that we could possibly spend eternity See, that's what you told me (that's what you said) But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams (If you really want me, babe)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? (Tell me, baby) And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"?  [Verse 2] You said you want my love and you've got to have it all But first, there are some things you need to know If you want to live with all I have to give I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah I don't want you trying to get with me And I end up unhappy (Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth (If I spend my life with you)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"? If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me?

And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"? If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me?

You used to make me feel like someone (Tell me, where did we go wrong) You were my best friend, my one and only love (You're still the only one)  Just as I'm leaving you You walk in the room I see the flicker in your eyes We say maybe not tonight  Repeat Chorus  Tag: You don't touch me anymore You never say the words I love you I love you  ",

Let's go  [Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas] You can hate me now, (Q.B.) But I won't stop now (Real niggas) 'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) You can hate me now (C'mon) But I won't stop now 'Cause I can't stop now You can hate me now You can hate me now  [Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)] Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too It's as simple as that Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die! You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now) Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now) Fuck y'all!  [Verse 1: Nas] Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy Ice that I wear, flows that I try Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin' Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper Almost a decade, quite impressive Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens Want me off the scene fast, but good things last Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest  [Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] Money is power, motherfucker! I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch!

Funny, I was just like you I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it Now y'all sayin': \"That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.\" Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G. People warn me, when you're on top there's envy Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you? Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code Gucci this, Fendi that \u2013 what you expect, ho?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy] You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life And that's what you can't understand!
