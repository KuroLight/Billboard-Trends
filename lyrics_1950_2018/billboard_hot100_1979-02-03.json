Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily  Just to let you know I'm gonna be home soon I'm kinda awkward and afraid Time has changed your point of view  How you gonna see me now? Please don't see me ugly babe 'Cause I know I let you down In oh so many ways  How you gonna see me now? Since we've been on our own Are you gonna love the man When the man gets home  Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess  Yes, I'm worried honey Guess that's natural though It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign Like a hobo in the snow  How you gonna see me now? Please don't see me ugly babe 'Cause I know I let you down In oh so many ways  How you gonna see me now? Since we've been on our own Are you gonna love the man When the man gets home  And just like the first time We're just strangers again I might have grown out of style In the place I've been  And just like the first time I'll be shakin' inside When I walk in the door There'll be no place to hide  How you gonna see me now? Please don't see me ugly babe 'Cause I know I let you down In oh so many ways  How you gonna see me now? Since we've been on our own Are you gonna love the man When the man gets home  ",

GIRL: Yes BOY: I bet you say that to all the boys...  [Verse 1] It was a hot summer night And the beach was burning There was fog crawling over the sand When I listen to your heart I hear the whole world turning I see the shooting stars falling Through your trembling hands  You were licking your lips And your lipstick shining I was dying just to ask for a taste We were lying together in a silver lining By the the light of the moon You know there's not another moment Not another moment Not another moment to waste  Oh, you hold me so close that my knees grow weak But my soul is flying high above the ground I'm trying to speak but no matter what I do I just can't seem to make any sound  [Chorus] And then you took the words right out of my mouth Oh it must have been while you were kissing me You took the words right out of my mouth And I swear it's true I was just about to say I love you And then you took the words right out of my mouth Oh it must have been while you were kissing me You took the words right out of my mouth And I swear it's true I was just about to say I love you (love you)  [Verse 2] Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water And I guess that I'm beginning to grin Oh we're finally alone and we can do what we want to The night is young And Ain't no-one gonna know where you No-one gonna know where you No-one's gonna know where you've been You were licking your lips And your lipstick shining I was dying just to ask for a taste We were lying together in a silver lining By the the light of the moon You know there's not another moment Not another moment Not another moment to waste  [Repeat Chorus]  ",
