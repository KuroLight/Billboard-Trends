You leave me so confused Now I'm all cried out Over you  (Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)  [Verse 2:112] Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray Oh, why was I such a fool, baby (Why was I such a fool) (Oh, yeah) Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me To find my way home, how could I be so wrong? (Leaving me all alone)  [Pre-Chorus 2:Allure & 112] Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno (Tears will cause an inferno baby) Romance often fades why should I take the blame? (Why should... why should I?) You were the one who left me neglected (Oh, I'm so sorry, baby) Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected  [Chorus 2] I... I gave you all of me How was I to know You would weaken so easily I... I don't know what to do Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out) Over you  [Chorus 3] I... I gave you my love in vain My body never knew such pleasure My heart never knew such pain And you...

It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay  After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just the part of me I can't let go  Couldn't stand to be kept away just for the day from your body Wouldn't wanna be swept away, far away from the one that I love Hold me now. It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to know Hold me now. I really want to tell you I'm sorry. I could never let you go  After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to And after all that's been said and done You're just the part of me I can't let go  After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you.
