Should I scream and shout? Should I speak of love? Let my feelings out?  I never thought I'd come to this What's it all about?  Don't you think its rather funny That I should be in this position? I'm the one who's always been So calm so cool No lover's fool Running every show He scares me so  I never thought I'd come to this What's it all about?  Yet, if he said he loved me I'd be lost, I'd be frightened I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope I'd turn my head, I'd back away I wouldn't want to know He scares me so I want him so I love him so  ",

With silver wings across the sky paper trails and wave goodbye To those below who've got to stay at home I wish that I had flown at night so I could take that champagne flight Rid myself of every tear I own Soaring high above the heaven in a 747 fighting back the tears that curse my eyes Captain's voice so load and clear amplifies into my ear Insuring me and flying friendly skies LA International Airport...
