We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension, man, what a ride I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror, a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln\"  ",
