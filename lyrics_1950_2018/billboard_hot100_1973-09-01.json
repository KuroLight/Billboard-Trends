I bet you he's even got a commie flag Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage.\" \"He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys He may look dumb but that's just a disguise He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage\" They all started looking real suspicious at him And he jumped up and said \"Now just wait a minute Jim! You know he's lying I been living here all of my life!\" \"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!\" Then he started saying something bout the way I was dressed But I didn't wait around to hear the rest I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck When I hit the ground I was making tracks And they were just taking my car down off the jacks So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up Mario Andretti would be sure been proud Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd Coming out the door and headed toward me at a trot And I guess I should of gone ahead and run But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot Well they headed for their car, but I hit the gas And spun around and headed them off at the pass I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air I had them all out there stepping and fetching Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catching Then I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there When I hit the road I was really wheeling Had gravel flying and rubber squealing And I didn't slow down till I was almost to Arkansas I think I'm going to reroute my trip I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped If I went to L.A., via Omaha  ",

[Chorus 3] And, they're coming to take me away ha haaa They're coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha haa To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time And I'll be happy to see those nice young men In their clean white coats And they're coming to take me away ha haaaa! To the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds And basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes And they're coming to take me away ha haaa! To the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats...  ",
