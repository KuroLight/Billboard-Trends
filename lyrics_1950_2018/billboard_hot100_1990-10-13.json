No she does not Really see me Cause she sees Her own reflection  And I'm trying Not to notice That she's hitching Up her skirt  And while she's Straightening her stockings Her hair Has gotten wet  Oh, this rain It will continue Through the morning As I'm listening  To the bells Of the cathedral I am thinking Of your voice...  And of the midnight picnic Once upon a time Before the rain began...  I finish up my coffee It's time to catch the train Tatatatatararatatatatarara  ",

We're selling records to a totally different audience I take a precaution that nobody else has I stickered my album I made two versions- two versions- two versions  [Verse 2: Brother Marquis] The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech So what you sayin'? It didn't include me? I like to party and have a good time There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhyme I know you don't think we'll ever quit We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip We're gonna do all the things we wanna do You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you This is the 90s and we're comin' on strong Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong Wisen up, cause on Election Day We'll see who's banned in the U-S-A!
