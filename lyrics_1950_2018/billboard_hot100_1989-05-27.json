Break it down  [Verse 4] Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection I took a shot as a contestant on \"The Love Connection\" The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding I said, \"Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya\" That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina  Ya know what I'm sayin That Medina's a monster, y'all  Funky Cold Medina  ",
