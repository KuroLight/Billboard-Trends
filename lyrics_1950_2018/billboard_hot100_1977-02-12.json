Oh, my darling How a love so right Can turn out to be so wrong?  Where did she go When I need her close to me? And the perfect story ended at the start I thought you came forever And you came to break my heart Now I'm hanging on On the chance that you'll come back to me Oh, my love  [Chorus] How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong? Oh, my darling How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong? Oh, my darling  [Bridge] I could take it in my stride Start living for the moment Maybe half the things we sought were never there Simply open up our eyes And break it down to size It isn't really fair  [Chorus] How a love so right Can turn out to be so wrong? Oh, my darling How a love so right Can turn out to be so wrong?  ",
