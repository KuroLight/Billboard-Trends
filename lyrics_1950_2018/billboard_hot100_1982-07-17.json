It's a lie A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be But you know what truth is? It's that little baby you're holding And it's that man you fought with this morning The same one you're going to make love with tonight That's truth, that's love  Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children That might have made me complete But I, I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet  I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring That costs too much to be free, hey, lady I've been to paradise But I've never been to me  I've been to paradise Never been to me  I've been to Georgia and California And anywhere I could run I've been to paradise Never been to me  Been to Nice and the isle of Greece When I've sipped champange on a yacht I've been to paradise Never been to to me  ",
