Can you tell me where Nat has gone? The last thing I heard him say, he was gonna look back over his life & before he could do it, he was gone Oh before he could do it, he was gone  & has anybody here seen my friend Sam Cooke Can anybody tell me where Sam has gone? The last thing he told me, that a change was gonna come But before he could see it, he was gone Oh before he could see it, he was gone  I've got another friend by the name of Otis Redding Can anybody tell me where Otis has gone? Last time I saw him, he was sittin' down by the dock of the bay I looked around for Otis & he was gone I looked around & my friend Otis Redding was gone  Hmmmm hmmmm oh I have to moan about it sometime, hmmmm & that makes me know I've got to leave here one day But I don't worry about it, for you know why I've got friends, oh yes I have, waitin' on me You know what they're gonna say when I get there? They will say, 'Come on in, Pickett. Sit down & rest awhile I know you're tired; I know you came from a mighty long ways I know you've had hard times, I know you had to give up life for long Come on in, don't worry no more, we will stand by you, we will never let you down Come on in, come on in, sit down, sit down' ... & fade  ",
