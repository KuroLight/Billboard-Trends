It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' {Suge} And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute, \u2018cause\u2014  [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers  [Verse 2] There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated, \u2018cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated \u2014 it ain't just words no more, is it? It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it! Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up \u2018Cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then! But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' Off at your jaws, well, then I can, \u2018cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not goin' to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience \u2018Cause\u2014  [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers  ",
