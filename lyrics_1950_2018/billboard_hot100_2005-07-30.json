Must have lost the track of time Oh, what was on my mind? From the club, went to her home Didn't plan to stay that long Here I am, quickly tryin to put on my clothes Searching for my car keys Tryin to get on up out the door Then she streched her hands in front of it Said, \"You can't go this way\" Looked at her, like she was crazy Said, \"Woman move out my way\" Said, \"I got a wife at home\" She said, \"Please don't go out there\" \"Lady, I've got to get home\" She said, her husband was comin up the stairs \"Shh, shh, quiet Hurry up and get in the closet\" She said, \"Don't you make a sound Or some shit is going down\" I said, \"Why don't I just go out the window?\" \"Yes, except for one thing, we on the 5th floor\" \"Shit think, shit think, shit quick, put me in the closet\" And now I'm in this darkest closet, tryin to figure out Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house And he walks in and yells, \"I'm home\" She says \"Honey I'm in the room\" He walks in there with a smile on his face Sayin, \"Honey, I've been missin you\" She hops all over him And says \"I've cooked and ran your bathwater\" I'm telling you now, this girl's so good that she deserves an Oscar Throws her in the bed And start to snatching her clothes off I'm in the closet, like man, \"what the fuck is going on?\" You're not gonna believe it But things get deeper as the story goes on Next thing you know, a call comes through on my cell phone I tried my best to quickly put it on vibrate But from the way he act, I could tell it was too late He hopped up and said, \"There\u2019s a mystery going on And I'm going to solve it\" And I'm like, \"God please, don't let this man open this closet\" He walks in the bathroom And looks behind the door She says, \"Baby, come back to bed\" He says, \"Bitch, say no more\" He pulls back the shower curtain While she's biting her nails Then he walks back to the room Right now, I'm sweating like hell Checks under the bed (bed) Then under the dresser (dresser) He looks at the closet (closet) I pull out my Beretta (Beretta) He walks up to the closet (closet) Get closer to the closet (closet) Now he's at the closet (closet) Now he\u2019s opening the closet (closet, closet, closet...)
