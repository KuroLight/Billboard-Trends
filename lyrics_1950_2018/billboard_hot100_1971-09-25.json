Anyway I got off with a caution A years conditional discharge But I'll always remember that policeman And his boogie woogie music So don't try to lay no boogie woogie On the king of rock and roll  Don't tell me nothing, don't lies, a woman 'Cause all you know I've told Don't sell me no alibis, sister 'Cause all you've got I've sold  You better leave at a-midnight slinking To the one who works it out I don't want to hear no rackem-tackem squeaking To go on and shut your mouth  And everything is gonna work out tight If you ain't like you been told Just don't try to lay no boogie woogie On the king of rock and roll  Don't feed me no TV dinners When you know that I'm used to steak I don't need no rank beginners When it's time to shake the shake  You better pull your thing together 'Cause you've been bested out And if you feel that you just can't dig it You know you don't know what it's all about  It ain't a matter of par convenience That's gonna justify your soul Just don't try to lay no boogie woogie On the king of rock and roll  Don't try to lay no boogie woogie On the king of rock and roll  You and I started to drive So don't pull nothing on me You didn't arrive til late '45 But your head's in '53  You got what it takes, give your heads a spin Down by the lonely shack But you come on just like a fool woman In the back of a red Cadillac  You can't come across the Upsalquitch Until you pay the toll So don't try to lay no boogie woogie On the king of rock and roll  ",
