Yep, I put lipstick on his collar At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?! But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo) I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!  [Hook] (Ice Cube) You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha! You can't play wit my Yo-Yo! Yeah, tell em whats up  [Verse 3: Yo-Yo] Yo, I hope you realize one day That you're \"weak\" as Monday through Sunday So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio And next to me? Ha! You're not fly, yo?! You lack skills to be a woman that's black Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?! Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya Because the world ain't a big soap opera It only takes one punch to drop ya And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya But no, I'm not living like that verse Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right) But no, it's not to cause corruptions Just to fight back on destruction Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?  [Hook] (Ice Cube) They know what time it is Fools, yeah! You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo I'm out. I thought you knew!  Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady Stompin' to the 90s! For all y'all suckas Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it You can't play wit my Yo-Yo  [Verse 4] I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, \"More, more!\" I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior Should we dare to take the stand And diss back all the men Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling? I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet If we wanna live with justice and harmony How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)  ",
