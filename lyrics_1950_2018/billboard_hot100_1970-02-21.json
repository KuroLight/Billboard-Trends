She's really got a magical spell And it's working so well That I can't get away  I'm a lucky fella And I just got to tell her That I love her endlessly Because love grows where my Rosemary goes And nobody knows like me  There's something about her hand holding mine It's a feeling that's fine And I just gotta say, hey! She's really got a magical spell And it's working so well That I can't get away  I'm a lucky fella And I just got to tell her That I love her endlessly Because love grows where my Rosemary goes And nobody knows like me  It keeps growing every place she's been And nobody knows like me If you've met her, you'll never forget her And nobody knows like me La la la, believe it when you've seen it Nobody knows like me  ",
