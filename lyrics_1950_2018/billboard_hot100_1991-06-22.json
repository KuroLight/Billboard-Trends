Won't you chase my clouds away? I'd give anything to see the sun again Only you can stop these tears from falling I can't face another day, baby, can you stop Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh  Everywhere I go I feel you there Following my footsteps like a shadow Of my broken heart  Sometimes it's a pair of passing eyes Or it's just the way someone is talking And there you are  Am I all alone Don't you ever wake up and reach for me Where I used to be Is there any chance I just can't believe you're not lonely too Just for me and you  Baby, can you stop the rain from falling? Won't you chase my clouds away? I'd give anything to see the sun again Only you can stop these tears from falling I can't face another day, baby, can you stop Can you stop the rain? Oh, oh  If you are here for only one night Baby, I know you remember 'Cause loving you once wasn't time enough I know we can make it together, together  Baby, stop the rain Won't you chase my clouds away I'd give anything to see the sun again Only you can stop these tears of mine from falling I can't face another day, baby, can you stop Can you, can you stop the rain  Can you stop the rain? Yeah How can I live without you, baby? How can I let you go? Yeah Chase my clouds away, yeah  ",
