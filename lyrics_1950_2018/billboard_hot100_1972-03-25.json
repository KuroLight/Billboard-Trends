I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, they\u2019d be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I\u2019d deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn\u2019t take one more step I can\u2019t remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  [Chorus] So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 2] Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock \u2019n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you\u2019re in love with him `cause I saw you dancin\u2019 in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin\u2019 buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 3] Now for ten years we\u2019ve been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin\u2019 stone But that\u2019s not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 4] Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 5] Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick Cause fire is the devil\u2019s only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan\u2019s spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing  [Chorus] Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 6] I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I\u2019d heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn\u2019t play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken; The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing  [Deleted Verse] And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\" They were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die\"  ",

Now, you must lie in that county jail Where I can't get to you by visit or mail So squirm - with discomfort - wiggle and cough Six days of madness, hah, and you might throw me off Curse me in name, defy me in speech But you'd pick me up right now if I were in your reach All through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate Hear now, young man and woman, I'll be waiting at the gate Don't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased Sure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste Behold, you're hooked Your foot is in the stirrup And make -- haste Mount the steed and ride him well For the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell To Hell Will ride you to Hell Until you are dead Dead, brother, Dead This is a revolution of the mind Get your mind together And get away from drugs That's the man Back, back  ",

        "lyrics": "  My pappy said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.\"  Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace That story is true, I'm here to say I was drivin' that Model A  It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up That Model A Vitimix makes it look like a pup It's got eight cylinders; uses them all It's got overdrive, just won't stall  With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust With 4.11 gears you can really get lost It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared The brakes are good, tires fair  Pulled out of San Pedro late one night The moon and the stars was shinin' bright We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill Passing cars like they was standing still  All of a sudden in a wink of an eye A Cadillac sedan passed us by I said, \"Boys, that's a mark for me!\" By then the taillight was all you could see  Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind Took my foot off the gas and man alive I shoved it on down into overdrive  Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten My speedometer said that I hit top end My foot was blue, like lead to the floor That's all there is and there ain't no more  Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense And telephone poles looked like a picket fence They said, \"Slow down! I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots.\"  Took a corner; sideswiped a truck Crossed my fingers just for luck My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts The guy beside me was white as a ghost  Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?  We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension. Man! What a ride! I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!\"  ",
