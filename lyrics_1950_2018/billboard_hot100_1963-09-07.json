Just pour it in and pump like mad and, buddy, you'll quench your thirst  [Chorus] Well, I found the jar, and I tell you, nothin' was ever prettier to my eye and I was tempted strong to drink it because that pump looked mighty dry, but the note went on, \"Have faith, my friend, there's water down below. You've got to give to really get. I'm the one who ought to know.\" So I poured in the jar and started pumpin' and I heard a beautiful sound of water bubblin' 'n' splashin' up out of that hole in the ground.
