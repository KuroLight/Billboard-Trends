My whole darn family's here\" (We gotta have a home, gotta have a home)  The farmer said to the boll weevil \"Say, why do you pick my farm?\" The weevil just laughed at the farmer 'n' said \"We ain't gonna do ya much harm\" (\"We're looking for a home\")  And the boll weevil spotted a lightning bug He said \"Hey, I'd like to make a trade with you But, ya see if I was a lightning bug, I'd search the whole night through\" (\"Searchin' for a home, I'd have me plenty of home\")  And the boll weevil called the farmer, 'n' he said \"Ya better sell your old machines 'Cause when I'm through with your cotton, heh You can't even buy gasoline.\" (I'm gonna stake me a home, gotta have a home)  And the boll weevil said to the farmer, said \"Farmer, I'd like to wish you well.\" Farmer said to the boll weevil, \"Yeah, an' I wish that you were in shit\" (Lookin' for a home, lookin' for a home) (Ahh, you have a home all right, you have a home) (A real hot home, ahh)  ",

Now, over yonder are a couple of your ole compadres.\" My, was I glad to see them, Carson Robison and the Mississippi blue yodeler Jimmie Rodgers  I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven {Oh what a beautiful sight}  Spoken: He introduced me to Wiley Post, and he showed me the Hall of Fame with all the gold guitars and fiddles Hanging on the walls. Then he said, \"Tex, step over this way, there are two more of your friends I know You'll want to see, they're waitin' for you.\" There they were standin' side by side and smilin' at me-- Hank Williams and Johnny Horton  I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven {Oh what a star-studded night}  Spoken: Then I asked him who else do you expect in the next, uh, say a hundred years? He handed me a large book Covered with star dust. Will called it the Big Tally Book. In it were many names and each name was branded In pure gold. I began to read some of them as I turned the pages: Red Foley, Ernest Tubb, Gene Autry Roy Acuff, Eddy Arnold, Tennessee Ernie, Jimmy Dean, Andy Griffith, Roy Rogers, Tex Ritter (Whaaaatttt???) Tex Ritter? Oh, well, that's when I woke up, and I'm sorry I did, because  I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven {Oh what a beautiful sight}  ",
