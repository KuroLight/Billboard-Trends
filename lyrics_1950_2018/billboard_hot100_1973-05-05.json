I don't know What makes him so good?  He ain't got no distractions, can't hear those buzzers and bells Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell Always has a replay 'n' never tilts at all That deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball  I thought I was the Bally table king But I just handed my pinball crown to him  Even on my usual table, he can beat my best His disciples lead him in and he just does the rest He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall That deaf dumb and blind kind sure plays a mean pinball  ",

Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind...cause I see love as just a State of mind...and who knows what it is that we might find...if we try  You're walking a different direction from most people I've met. You're givin' Me signs of affection I don't usually get. I don't want you to pledge your Future the future's not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let Me watch while you live  'Cause when I see you on the street, I lose my concentration. And just the Thought that we might meet creates anticipation  Won't you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you ought to Know. Well I've been thinking about you day and night...and I don't know if it Will work out right...but somehow I think that it just might...if we try Somehow I think that it just might if we try. Yes somehow I think that it just Might if we try  ",

        "lyrics": "  We ran through hills and forests As two under a spell He was a city boy, Floyd the outlaw But I thought I knew him well  Long after that great summer When I first came into my fame And the avenger from Oklahoma Was added to my name The avenger I became  Well, they call me avenging Annie I'm avenger of womanhood I spend my whole life telling lies Lead you on and mess you over good  I take all you spoiled young hippies Running around, playing games Mess around in your bed I'll blow your head I'll put you through a change  What you've done to others I'll do unto you  And then I met my Sensitive outlaw He was the best thing I had ever seen  I wanna be his wife Forgiving my life I was so blind I could never have seen, no  So I joined up with my outlaw And headed for California  He treated me worse Than I ever imagined He even say he don't want me around  Kept it up so long I couldn't be strong He run me right into the ground  After five long years He picked me up and Then he slapped me down  When I told my friends about him They all were on my side But I could see through the haze He looked so crazy I put my head right down And I cried  For my poor lover I cried like a mother For my poor lover  Well, I felt so sad about it But I knew I couldn't do him no good He was so far gone While standing all alone I left him, I knew I should I knew I couldn't do him no good  And now I live out on a mountain top And I'm almost thirty-five And I've found my peace And I've found my release And I'm happy just to be alive  And I might go back to my Floyd If I think it's the thing to do He gave up murder and theft Right after I left And you know I still love him too  Just like your woman loves you [Repeat 14x]  Well, they call me avenging Annie I'm avenger of womanhood I spend my whole life telling lies Lead you on and mess you over, yeah  They call me avenging Annie I'm avenger of womanhood I spend my whole life telling lies Lead you on and mess you over, yeah  ",
