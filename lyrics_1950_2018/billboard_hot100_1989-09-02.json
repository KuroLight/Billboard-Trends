Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed At the boys from home, they all came running They were making noise, manhandling toys That's the girls on the block with the nasty curls Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Yeah Timmy... Tell it like it is! Check out this DJ  [Verse 2:] So you say you wanted money but you know it's never funny When your shoes worn through and there's a rumble in your tummy But you had to have style get a gold tooth smile Put a girl on the corner so you can make a pile Committed a crime and went inside It was coming your way but you had to survive When you lost your babe, you lost the race Now you're looking at me to take her place  [Pre-Chorus]  Smokin.' Not cokin.' Get funky sax Looking good, hanging with the wild bunch Looking good in a Buffalo Stance Looking good when it comes to the crunch Looking good's a state of mind State of mind don't look behind you State of mind or you'll be dead State of mind may I remind you Bomb the Bass...rock this place!

This pretty little girl In the worn out clothes That have been hand-me down Is this your wife, Jackie Brown? With sad blue eyes, walking on eggshells so you don't see her frown Is this your family, Jackie Brown?  Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream And giving the world more than it gave you What ugly truths freedom brings And it hasn't been very kind to you Is this your life, Jackie Brown?  Is this your meal, Jackie Brown? Barely enough, I've seen people throw away more than this out Is this your home, Jackie Brown? This three room shack With no running water And the bathroom out back Is this your grave, Jackie Brown? This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took himself out Is this your dream, Jackie Brown?  Going nowhere and nowhere fast We shame ourselves to watch people like this live But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown? Just another lazy man who couldn't take what was his One helluva life Jackie Brown Forevermore, Jackie Brown Amen and amen - Jackie Brown?  ",

Oh the night that we first met The moment I looked in your eyes I never will forget Do you remember oh the time that we first kissed Remember thinking to myself could it really be like this  And we danced beneath the midnight moon Whoa! I took one look One look at you And I fell in love before I knew And the night stood still And like a breeze we moved cool and slow To the rhythm of the radio And I reached out for you and held you close And the night stood still  I still remember how our song was playing then And if I close my eyes I swear That we'd be there again Do you remember oh the way it used to be Where we were two hearts on the run So young so wild and free  And we danced beneath the midnight moon Whoa! I took one look One look at you And I fell in love before I knew And the night stood still And like a breeze we moved cool and slow To the rhythm of the radio And I reached out for you and held you close And the night stood still  Girl The night stood still We danced Danced We fell in love We fell in love  Do you remember oh the way it used to be... Where we were two hearts on the run So young so wild and free  And we danced beneath the midnight moon Whoa! I took one look One look at you And I fell in love before I knew And the night stood still And like a breeze we moved cool and slow To the rhythm of the radio And I reached out for you and held you close And the night stood still  And we danced beneath the midnight moon Whoa!
