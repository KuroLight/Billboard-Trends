I'll never know what made you run away How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day (Oh) I only know there's nothing here for me Nothing in this wide world Left for me to see  But I'll keep on waiting Till you return I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn You can't be happy while your heart's on a roam You can't be happy until you bring it home Home to the greenfields and me once again  ",
