[Chorus]  [Verse 3] Now, Snoopy had sworn that he'd get that man So he asked the Great Pumpkin for a new battle plan He challenged the German to a real dogfight While the Baron was laughing, he got him in his sight  [Musical interlude]  That Bloody Red Baron was in a fix He'd tried everything, but he'd run out of tricks Snoopy fired once, and he fired twice And that Bloody Red Baron went spinning out of sight  [Chorus to fade]  ",

When you change with every new day Still I'm going to miss you  [Verse 3] \"There's no time to lose,\" I heard her say \"Catch your dreams before they slip away Dying all the time Lose your dreams and you Will lose your mind Ain't life unkind?\"  [Chorus] Goodbye Ruby Tuesday Who could hang a name on you? When you change with every new day Still I'm going to miss you  Goodbye Ruby Tuesday Who could hang a name on you? When you change with every new day Still I'm going to miss you  ",
