Feels like the first time ) It feels like the very first time  {Bridge} Open up the door Won't you open up the door? Yeah Feels like the first time And it feels like the very first time And it feels like the first time It feels like the very first time Feels like the first time And it feels like the very first time And it feels like the first time It feels like the very first time  {outro}  ",
