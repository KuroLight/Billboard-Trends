Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  And shake me and my confidence 'Bout a great many things But I've been there, I can see it cower Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings  Of a bad play where the heroes are right And nobody thinks or expects too much And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing, \"Hey babe, let's keep in touch Hey baby, let's keep in touch\"  But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me And show me all the things no one else can see So what you feel becomes mine as well And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking And I got some news for you It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can do  Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink in and always be full Yeah, I will drink in and always be full  Oh, I like coffee and I like tea Like to be able to enter a final plea I still got this dream that you just can't shake I love you to the point you can no longer take Well, all right, okay, so be that way I hope and pray that there's something left to say  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  Oh, you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  ",

Sure Never hesitate to call me after I'm done Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones Too many wakes and funerals full of tears You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad Reminds me of a situation that I once had Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock And don't nobody mind their business He say she say throwin' salt about it And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin' A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin' Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around  [Hook] Whenever you call me: I'll be there Whenever you want me: I'll be there Whenever you need me: I'll be there I'll be around  Life ain't based on peaches and cream This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams Future doctors, producers, and mothers The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat Then they want a gat you livin' like that? Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me? Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics So I'm doin' what we call a roll call Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall I spit the street life and then I go underground You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around  [Hook]  Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind Or learn about life before you're left behind But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right When you get mad all you want is a gunfight This tension causes a gang of madness Now you want funk that results to sadness Sadness results to a lot of revenge And your so called friends really ain't your friends So how do you know who you're able to trust If you think about the past look what happened to us I never trust no one, I only trust myself Or I would've been a victim like everyone else In friendship or hardship whenever you need me Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin' Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin' This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste I drop the rap and J drops the bass To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco Droppin' a message out of love to your town Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around  [Hook]  ",

I asked my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself While they kickback and just collect the wealth And now I'm thinking... Ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis T-shirt dingy, Pro Wings tacky This could be a way for me to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned Right then is when I learned that...
