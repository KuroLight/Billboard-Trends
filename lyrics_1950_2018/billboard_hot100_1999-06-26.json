And I refuse to let you play me for a fool You said that we could possibly spend eternity See, that's what you told me (that's what you said) But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams (If you really want me, babe)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? (Tell me, baby) And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"?  [Verse 2] You said you want my love and you've got to have it all But first, there are some things you need to know If you want to live with all I have to give I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah I don't want you trying to get with me And I end up unhappy (Don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain) So before I do give myself to you I have to know the truth (If I spend my life with you)  [Chorus] If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me? And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue Would you lie to me and call me \"baby\"? If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust Would you comfort me?

[Deborah] Tryin' to forget about Ordinary things, typical, predictable Ooh, baby I knew the end before it started, hmm You got me feelin' like I owe you something Cuz you were there in times when I had nothing But you threw it all away with the shady things you do  2 -     Baby, please forgive me For what I'm 'bout to say And what I'm 'bout to do I can't take no more I know you ain't been true Ain't got no love for you  Repeat 1  Relying on my intuition And pass it off as a suspicion But you were just so bold You kept putting it in my face, yeah I can't deny I let you hurt me, oh no  Repeat 2 Repeat 1  You couldn't have appreciated my love The love that we shared You made a fool of yourself So keep on walking Now girl go up and you tell him There ain't no time for him  [Dyme] Hey you're not, what? Dyme baby put it down You ain't know I got to go What you thought, I was gonna stay with you When I know about all that dirt you doing The creeping, cheating Sneaking out the house while I'm sleeping I doubt that, like I'm havin' it Go ahead with them loose and half-naked chicks Thinking that they too Dyme for that I bet that, when I'm gone, y'all miss the cat It's over now, no Rover now You getting back to your Nova now I bet you didn't know I labeled you a clown now See me getting dough and wanna come around now Stop talking 'bout your cars, your rocks His and her's furs with that played out fox I'mma dead Pac so those chicks look back All you gonna see is backside and hips, yeah  Repeat 1  ",
