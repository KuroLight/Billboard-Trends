Total darkness at ease be at all one I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate You took his life, but your memory you'll never take You'll be headed to another place And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face I still gotta wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen a man die  [Verse 3: Scarface] I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low Stop trying to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here You start your journey into outer space You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life And you see the ones you never learn to love in life Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace I still got to wonder why I never seen a man cry 'til I seen that man die  ",
