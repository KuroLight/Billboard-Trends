Goode Who never ever learned to read or write so well But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell  [Chorus] Go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Johnny B. Goode  [Verse 2] He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made People passing by they would stop and say Oh my that little country boy could play  [Chorus] Go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Go Johnny go, go Johnny B. Goode  [Verse 3] His mother told him \"Someday you will be a man And you will be the leader of a big old band Many people coming from miles around To hear you play your music when the sun go down Maybe someday your name will be in lights Saying 'Johnny B. Goode Tonight'\"  [Chorus] Go, go Go Johnny go Go go go, Johnny go Oh go go, Johnny go Oh go go, Johnny go Go, Johnny B. Goode  ",
