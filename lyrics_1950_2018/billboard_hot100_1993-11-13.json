That I would do anything for love! And I'll be there till the final act And I would do anything for love! And I'll take the vow and seal a pact  But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way Tonight  And I would do anything for love! Oh I would do anything for love! Oh I would do anything for love! But I won't do that! No I won't do that!  I would do anything for love Anything you've been dreaming of But I just won't do that...  I would do anything for love Anything you've been dreaming of But I just won't do that...  I would do anything for love Anything you've been dreaming of But I just won't do that...  And some days I pray for Silence And some days I pray for Soul Some days I just pray to the God Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll  And some nights I lose the feeling And some nights I lose control Some nights I just lose it all When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls  And maybe I'm lonely That's all I'm qualified to be There's just one and only One and only promise I can keep  As long as the wheels are turning As long as the fires are burning As long as your prayers are coming true You better believe it!  That I would do anything for love! And you know it's true and thats a fact I would do anything for love! And there'll never be no turning back  But I'll never do it better than I do it with you So long So long  And I would do anything for love Oh, I would do anything for love I would do anything for love But I won't do that, No No. No, I won't do that!  I would do anything for love Anything you've been dreaming of But I just won't do that...  I would do anything for love Anything you've been dreaming of But I just won't do that...

But I'll never stop dreaming of you every night of my life No way  And I would do anything for love Oh I would do anything for love Oh I would do anything for love But I won't do that No I won't do that  Lorraine Crosby: Will you raise me up? Will you help me down? Will you help get me right out of this Godforsaken town? Will you make it all a little less cold?  Meat Loaf: I can do that! I can do that!  Lorraine Crosby: Will you hold me sacred Will you hold me tight Will you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white! Can you make it all a little less old  Meat Loaf: I can do that! Oh, Oh, I can do that!  Lorraine Crosby: Will you make me some magic with your own two hands? Can you build an Emerald city with these grains of sand? Can you give me something I can take home?  Meatloaf: I can do that I can do that  Lorraine Crosby: Will you cater to every fantasy I've got? Will ya hose me down with holy water - If I get too hot? Will you take me to places I'll never know?  Meat Loaf: I can do that! I can do that!  Lorraine Crosby: After a while you'll forget everything Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling Then you'll see that it's time to move on  Meat Loaf: I won't do that I won't do that  Lorraine Crosby: I know the territory - I've been around It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down Sooner or later you'll be screwing around  Meat Loaf: I won't do that! No I won't do that!  Anything for love Oh I would do anything for love! I would do anything for love! But I won't do that! No I won't do that...  ",

It's all about soul  She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming And I realize I must have gone a million miles away And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say  It's all about soul It's all about knowing what someone is feeling The woman's got soul The power of love and the power of healing This life isn't fair It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold You've got to get tough, but that ain't enough It's all about soul  There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive  It's all about soul It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow It's all about soul Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow You've got to be hard Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n roll But that's only part, you know in your heart It's all about soul  ",
