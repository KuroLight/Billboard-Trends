        "lyrics": "  My sister's little boy came in the kitchen one evening While she was fixing supper And he handed her a piece paper he had been writing on And after wiping her hands on an apron She took it in her hands and read it And this is what it said:  For mowing the yard five dollars And for making up my own bed this week one dollar For going to the store fifty cents And playing with little brother while you went shopping twenty five cents Taking out the trash one dollar And for getting a good report card five dollars And for raking the yard two dollars Total owed one fourteen seventy five  Well she looked at him standing there and expecting And a thousand memories flashed through her mind So she picked up pen and turned the paper over and this is what she wrote:  For the 9 months I carried you holding you inside me $ no charge For the nights I sat up with doctored you and prayed for you $ no charge For the time and tears and the costs through the years There is no charge When you add it all up the full cost of my love is $ no charge  For the nights filled with grey And the worries ahead For the advice and the knowledge And the costs of your college There is no charge For the toys, school, and clothes And for wiping your nose There's no charge son When you add it all the full cost of my love is no charge  Well you know when I think about that I think about the day that jesus went out to calvary and gave his life as a ransom for me When I think on the words \"if any man be in christ he's a new creature\" I like to think about the very minute that he shedded his blood My debt was paid in full And I want you to know today When you add it all up The full cost of real love is no charge  ",
