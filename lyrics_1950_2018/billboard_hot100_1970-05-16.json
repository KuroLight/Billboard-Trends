The old man would carve toys for the little girl, and she would draw pictures for him of beautiful ladies surrounded by green trees and sunshine, and they laughed alot. But then on the first day of June, the little girl ran to the fence to show the man a picture she had drawn, BUT HE WASN'T THERE! And somehow, the little girl knew he wasn't coming back. So she went back to her little room, took out a crayola and a piece of paper, and wrote:  \"Whoever finds this, I love you!\" \"Whoever finds this, I need you!\" \"I don't even have no one to talk to.\" \"So, whoever finds this, I love you!\"  ",
