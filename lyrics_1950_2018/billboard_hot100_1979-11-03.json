Can't you feel them schooling around? You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only girl in town  Sailed off to Antigua It took her three days on a boat Looking for some peace and quiet Maybe keep her dreams afloat But now she feels like A remora With the school still close at hand Just behind the reef are the big white teeth Of the sharks that can swim on the land  Can't you feel them circling, honey?
