I said \"no ma'm, it's a Kenny Rodgers stunt double\"  Here's your sign  The other day I bought a wreath to go on our front door As I was walking out the store a man stopped me and said \"hey, are you going to hang that on your door\"? I said \"no sir, it's a Christmas toilet seat cover, got the idea from Martha Stewart\"  Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign  I hung those little Christmas lights on my house, you know the kind that blink on and off My neighbour comes over and says \"Bill how do you get those to blink on and off like that\"? I said \"I've got my son inside plugging and unplugging it, plugging and unplugging it\"  Here's your sign  I took my family to buy a Christmas tree the other night When we walked onto the lot this guy walked up to me and says \"hey, y'all here to buy a Christmas tree?\" I said, \"no sir, my son needs to go to the bathroom and these trees looked really inviting\"  Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign Have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time  The other night my family and I were walking through the neighbourhood looking at all the Christmas decorations When we came across this house that had a manger scene Now there was this whole group of people looking at it when I overheard this one guy say \"hey, are those the Three Wise Men\"? I said \"no sir that's ZZ Top doing a farming concert  Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You acted dumb, so have some fun and wear your stupid sign Oh! Here's your sign, Here's your sign, Here's your stupid sign You lost your mind, so pay the fine and wear your stupid sign  Here's your sign, Here's your sign, here's your stupid sign (have no fear when you're spreading cheer during Christmas time)  And finally my wife and I were in a grocery store the other day and I heard a woman ask the clerk \"do you know what time Midnight Mass starts on Christmas Eve\"? And in the holiday spririt I walked over and said \"Here's your sign\"  Happy holidays everybody!  ",

Why did you clean the floor? Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door? This is where we used to live  Why did you keep the mousetrap? Why did you keep the dish rack? These things used to be mine I guess they still are, I want them back  Broke into the old apartment Forty-two steps from the street Crooked landing, crooked landlord Narrow laneway filled with crooks This is where we used to live  Why did they pave the lawn? Why did they change the locks? Why did I have to break in, I only came here to talk This is where we used to live  How is the neighbour downstairs? How is her temper this year? I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun I know we don't live here anymore We bought an old house on the Danforth She loves me and her body keeps me warm I'm happy there But this is where we used to live  Broke into the old apartment Tore the phone out of the wall Only memories, fading memories Blending into dull tableaux  I want them back  ",
