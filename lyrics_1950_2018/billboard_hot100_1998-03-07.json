How do I get myself back to the place Where you said?  [Chorus: Stephan Jenkins] I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Goodbye  [Verse 3: Stephan Jenkins] I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling, an earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right, all right And when the plane came in She said she was crashing The velvet it rips in the city We tripped on the urge to feel alive But now I'm struggling to survive Those days you were wearing that velvet dress You're the priestess I must confess Those little red panties, they pass the test Slide up around the belly face Down on the mattress one And you hold me and we are broken Still it's all that I want to do, just a little now Feel myself head made of the ground I'm scared, I'm not coming down, no, no And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws now locked down in a smile But nothing is all right, all right  [Chorus: Stephan Jenkins] I want something else To get me through this Life, baby I want something else Not listening when you say Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye Goodbye  [Refrain: Stephan Jenkins] Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  [Outro: Stephan Jenkins] The sky was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there, some place back there In the place we would start out lives  [Refrain: Stephan Jenkins] Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (I want something else)  ",
