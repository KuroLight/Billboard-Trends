Do it twice! Your boy the B-I-G I'm nicer than MC on your top three You cocky, I cock, squeeze Bust them things, now you sloppy Speed it up, slow it down then screw it Don't bite the flow 'cause I got that fluid Run through the crew on some whole other new shit Newness, bitch, we do this  [Hook: T-Pain] I'm out the hood!
