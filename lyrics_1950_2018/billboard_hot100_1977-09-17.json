Now in twenty-eight years of eating hamburgers I ain't never run into no Martian Not at 2:30 in the morning and certainly Not at a fine scarfing establishment like Eat  Well, he was sitting over there with a Bunch of colored sticks on his plate And I looked over at him and I said \"What you eating there, boy, crayons?\" He said, \"Why no! They're Martian cigarettes! Here, try one!\"  Well, 'bout half hour later He looked over at me and smiled Them ol' Martians ain't got But two teeth in their head And he said, \"How do you feel?\"  And I said, \"Weeeeeeell, I feel so good Yeah, I do, gonna boogie Wow! Til the break of day!\"  Meanwhile, back at Eat's I was stiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill thinking, I said \"How come out of all the places You could have landed You ended up here?\"  He said, \"Well, according To my lunar space map This town here is supposed to be The boogie capital of the U.S.A!\"  So I asked him, I said \"Now, where else you been, boy?\" And he told me  He said, \"I've rocked 'em over And I've rocked 'em down Rocked 'em in the country I've rocked 'em in town Rock 'n' roll, Memphis on up to Maine Woke up a lady and she asked my name! Told her the name was on ten of my shirts Told her, rocking chair Martian Don't have to work!\"  Yeah, I feel so good Yeah, yeah, gonna boogie Martian boogie  ",

And then he says Now when other fellas call ya Tell 'em how it all began Well, can you imagine?  My heart began a-thumpin' And my mind began to fly And I knew I wasn't dealin' With no ordinary guy  So while he was a-talking I was thinkin' up my plan Then my fingers did the walkin' On the telephone man  Singin hey lolly, lolly Hey lolly, lolly Hey lolly, lolly Get it any way you can Right? Ha, ha, ha, so  I got it in the bedroom And I got it in the hall And I got it in the bathroom And he hung it on the wall  I got it with a buzz And I got it with a ring And when he told me What my number was I got a ding-a-ling  A-singin hey lolly, lolly Hey lolly, lolly Hey lolly, lolly Just-a doin' my thing  Ha, ha...I've never done anything Like this before  ",

        "lyrics": "  Sometimes the love rhymes that fill that afternoon Lose all their meaning with the rising moon Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true Answer the question I must ask of you .....  Do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? I guarantee it will bring you down If you try and fool yourself Do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? You can take it seriously Or take it somewhere else  Take all the freedom that a lover will allow If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep Don't make a promise that you cannot keep  Do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? I guarantee it will bring you down If you try and fool yourself Do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? You can take it seriously Or take it somewhere else  If you wanna get close to me You could do it so easily Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes Or just another empty lie?  Do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? I guarantee it will bring you down If you try and fool yourself Well, do you wanna make love Or do you just want to fool around? You can take it seriously Or take it somewhere else  ",
