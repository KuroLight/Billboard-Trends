She's so far gone she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're still the same old girl you used to be  [Chorus] You can't hide your lying eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes  ",

A booth in the midwest Ten years ago I bought you some cufflinks You brought me something We both know what memories can bring They bring diamonds and rust  Well you burst on the scene Already a legend The unwashed phenomenon The original vagabond You strayed into my arms And there you stayed Temporarily lost at sea The Madonna was yours for free Yes the girl on the half-shell Would keep you unharmed  Now I see you standing With brown leaves falling around And snow in your hair Now you're smiling out the window Of that crummy hotel Over Washington Square Our breath comes out white clouds Mingles and hangs in the air Speaking strictly for me We both could have died then and there  Now you're telling me You're not nostalgic Then give me another word for it You who are so good with words And at keeping things vague Because I need some of that vagueness now It's all come back too clearly Yes I loved you dearly And if you're offering me diamonds and rust I've already paid  ",

        "lyrics": "  Pleasure's the motivation for the human race Everything starts and ends with sex and appeal Feeling good is the bait, Satan uses to fish for you and me Comfort is the poison when it's the spirit he wants to kill  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  There's such a need for us to feel nice and it's getting better We got to have it more than we ought to The preacher keeps promisin' satisfaction The ladies keep giving up the gratifaction You know what? I'm feeling better by the pound  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  You know what? I'm feeling better by the pound I'm feeling better by the pound  Joyful is the hocus pocus that's haunting all mankind Said he couldn't be what he needs to be you see He and only he is free Well, he who is truly free Say, free from the need to be free  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  ",
