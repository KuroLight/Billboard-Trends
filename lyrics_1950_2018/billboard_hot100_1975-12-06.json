She's so far gone she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're still the same old girl you used to be  [Chorus] You can't hide your lying eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes  ",

He is not the guy!\u201d Yes, here\u2019s the story of the Hurricane The man the authorities came to blame For something that he never done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  [Verse 6] Four months later, the ghettos are in flame Rubin\u2019s in South America, fighting for his name While Arthur Dexter Bradley\u2019s still in the robbery game And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame \u201cRemember that murder that happened in a bar?\u201d \u201cRemember you said you saw the getaway car?\u201d \u201cYou think you\u2019d like to play ball with the law?\u201d \u201cThink it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are white\u201d  [Verse 7] Arthur Dexter Bradley said, \u201cI\u2019m really not sure\u201d Cops said, \u201cA poor boy like you could use a break We got you for the motel job and we\u2019re talking to your friend Bello Now you don\u2019t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow You\u2019ll be doing society a favor That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver We want to put his ass in stir We want to pin this triple murder on him He ain\u2019t no Gentleman Jim\u201d  [Verse 8] Rubin could take a man out with just one punch But he never did like to talk about it all that much It\u2019s my work, he\u2019d say, and I do it for pay And when it\u2019s over I\u2019d just as soon go on my way Up to some paradise Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice And ride a horse along a trail But then they took him to the jailhouse Where they try to turn a man into a mouse  [Verse 9] All of Rubin\u2019s cards were marked in advance The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance The judge made Rubin\u2019s witnesses drunkards from the slums To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga No one doubted that he pulled the trigger And though they could not produce the gun The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed And the all-white jury agreed  [Verse 10] Rubin Carter was falsely tried The crime was murder \u201cone,\u201d guess who testified? Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride How can the life of such a man Be in the palm of some fool\u2019s hand? To see him obviously framed Couldn\u2019t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land Where justice is a game  [Verse 11] Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell An innocent man in a living hell That\u2019s the story of the Hurricane But it won\u2019t be over till they clear his name And give him back the time he\u2019s done Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been The champion of the world  ",
