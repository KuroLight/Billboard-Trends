I wish we didn't have to Keep our love out of sight, yeah  Living two lives Just ain't easy at all But we gotta hang on in there Or fall  Secret lovers, yeah That's what we are Trying so hard to hide the way we feel Because we both belong to someone else  But we can't let it go Cause what we feel Is, oh, so real So real, so real  You and me Are we fair? Is this cruel Or do we care?  Can they tell What's in our minds Maybe they've had secret loves All of the time  In the middle of making love We notice the time We both get nervous Cause it's way after 9:00  Even though we hate it We know it's time that we go We gotta be careful So that no one will know  Secret lovers, yeah That's what we are We shouldn't be together But we can't let it go  Cause what we feel Is, oh, so real So real, so real So real, so real  ",

[Verse 1:] I was at home feeling sleazy So I went down to the speakeasy As soon as my feet hit the door I had all attention from the dance floor  [Chorus:] Don't you know the men all pause? When I walked into the room The men all pause  The men all pause When I walked into the room The men all pause And the brides held their grooms  And they all sang the same old tune Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Check me out Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa Whoa, whoa, whoa  [Verse 2:] Staring faces starting to get tired I wanted to get out And go for a ride Maybe this boredom created my hunger So I said, \"Pull over at the local fat burger\"  I tried to walk in shy Very unnoticed But the men turned away From their burgers and sodas  The focus was on me I guess admiring good taste I tried to play it off But assurance was all over my face  [Repeat Chorus:]  [Bridge:] The men all pause When I hit the door Attention came from the dance floor When I went to the burger stand I had my claim on any man  Slap me, no Somebody slap me 'Cause I know I'm looking good  I'm giving attitude all over the room People are staring at me And I just look too good For these people  Don't you know the men all pause? Yeah, just look at them (Woof)  The dog is coming out of them A natural dog Radar (Woof) Radar, kitty girl  I think I'm gonna leave right now Because I have some things to do Call my chauffeur I love you I love you all, but I got to go  Oh, turn me on The men all pause The men all pause The men all pause The men all pause  [Repeat Chorus:]  ",
