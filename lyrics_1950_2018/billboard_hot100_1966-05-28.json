One day Bad Max happened into town His aim was to shoot fat Irving down Bad Max said, \"Draw, and draw right now!\" And Irving drew, drew a picture of a cow  Irving Big, fat Irving Big gunfighter Irving The hundred and forty-second fastest gun in the West ----  The James Boys was comin' on a train at first sun And the town said, \"Irving, we need your gun.\" When that train pulled in at the break of dawn Irving's gun was there, but Irving was gone  Irving Big, fat Irving Big help, Irving The hundred and forty-second fastest gun in the West  Well, finally Irving got three slugs in the belly It was right outside the Frontier Deli He was sittin' there twirlin' his gun around And butterfingers Irving gunned himself down!
