Sit all alone by the telephone? Wait for the day that you might come home Savin' myself for you  Now did you really believe I never looked at another guy C`mon that night and you sit to cry Savin' myself for you  After you were gone I realized my life was moving on You`d be surprised How quickly people start to come around You'd never know that I'd be lonely Couldn't help fall in love again  What did you think I would do? Sit all alone by the telephone? Wait for the day that you might come home Savin' myself for you  Now did you really believe I never looked at another guy C`mon that night and you sit to cry Savin' myself for you  Now you gave your heart to someone else And threw our love away So I found myself for another love And I know it`s gonna stay  ",

Everyone used to run them down They're a little too sweet, they're a little too tight, not enough tough for this town Couldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole, no, it didn't seem to rattle at all They were glued together body and soul, that much more with their backs up against the wall Oh, hold them up, hold them up, never do let them fall Prey to the dust and the rust and the ruin that names us and claims us and shames us all I guess it had to happen someday soon- wasn't nothing to hold them down They would rise from among us like a big balloon, take the sky, forsake the ground Oh, yes, other hearts were broken, yeah, other dreams ran dry But our golden ones sail on, sail on to another land beneath another sky (Let other hearts be broken, let other dreams run dry) But our golden ones sail on, sail on to another land beneath another sky, beneath another sky  [Outro] Hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up, hold them up (Hold them up, don't let them fall)  ",
