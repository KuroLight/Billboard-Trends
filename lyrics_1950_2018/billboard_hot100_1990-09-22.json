Shay plays on the fade Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade So fast, other DJs say \"Damn!\" If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram Keep my composure when it's time to get loose Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice If there was a problem yo I'll solve it Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it  [Hook] Ice ice baby Ice ice baby  [Outro] Yo man let's get out of here Word to your mother Ice ice baby too cold Ice ice baby too cold too cold Ice ice baby  ",

First Amendment protects material, presumptively  [Intro: Luke] We don't talk about, uh, harassing and sexually brutalizing women in my music, man! We don't do that in my music, man! I'm tired of you saying that!  [Verse 1: Fresh Kid Ice] We've got white-collar people trying to grab our style Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live Corrupted politicians playing games Bringing us down to boost their fame They must be joking thinking we will fall But they're like flies movin' the wall We stand tall from beginning to end With the help from fans and all our friends Freedom of speech will never die For us to help, our ancestors died Don't keep thinking that we will quit We'll always stand and never sit We're 2 Live, 2 black, 2 strong Doing the right thing, and not the wrong So listen up, y'all, to what we say We won't be banned in the U-S-A!  [Chorus] Banned in the U-S-A I was Banned in the U-S-A I was Banned in the U-S-A I was Banned in the U-S-A I was  [Interlude: Various Samples] Luke's concerts are for adults If it's an adult show you have to be 18 Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity There's a lot of people- curiosity is aroused! We're selling records to a totally different audience I take a precaution that nobody else has I stickered my album I made two versions- two versions- two versions  [Verse 2: Brother Marquis] The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech So what you sayin'? It didn't include me? I like to party and have a good time There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhyme I know you don't think we'll ever quit We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip We're gonna do all the things we wanna do You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you This is the 90s and we're comin' on strong Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong Wisen up, cause on Election Day We'll see who's banned in the U-S-A!

[Interlude: Luke] What is this? Is this not America? This is not China! This is not Russia! This is not the place where they brought down the wall This is America! We have the right to say what we want to say We have the right to do what we want to do And what I do in my house, you might not do in your house So what I do in my house is my business And the simple fact of it all is that we are bonded by the First Amendment! We have the freedom of expression! We have the freedom of choice! And you, Chinese, black, green, purple, Jew You have the right to listen to whoever you want to And even the 2 Live Crew!

(With your badself)  [Verse 1: King Tee] It's straight up madness everywhere I look Used to be a straight a student, now he's a crook Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang Hanging on the streets selling 'caine To his own people Now when I say people I mean color You a stupid mother- I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb Get yourself presentable, son, and just come Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late A message from King Tee The Great  [Verse 2: Body & Soul] Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth It's time we start being good mothers from the birth Of our children, no time for sleeping Teach them to fight and win for the right reason It's your time, it's your life, live it Proud to be black, young and gifted Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route Gang violence needs to be wiped out A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E We see the F-U-T-U-R-E Should be a positive thing Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang  [Verse 3: Def Jef] One and the same Everyone came in the same chains Caught with the same aim Brain games and names changed To protect the innocent by-stander Lies, slander and the master-planner Destroy the black male Crack jail and semi-automatic For static if the crack fails So since we all talk the same slang Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang  [Michel'le] Don't you know we've got to put our heads together? Make the change cause we're all in the same gang  [Verse 4: Tone-Loc] Now as a youth I used to get my bang on And on the ave get my part-time slang on Doing time for me was no joke though They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty Low ridin and tossin up a forty Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles I found life was much more suitable Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful I ain't slippin or down with a head trip I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man It's time to fight, unite and be a black man Tone-Loc is on a positive change Cause remember, we're all in the same gang  [Verse 5: Above The Law] Bein' the pimps that we are We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far Here at home in the ghettos of LA Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats But fools just lay and prey on the weak It don't depend on the color of a rag Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs And gangs that bang Most times it's a political thang Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped But they don't because they want it like that Because the system been set up to hold us back Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever So why don't we stick together? (You got it)  [Verse 6: Ice-T] Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke) Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain I got an idea, give me a minute And if it makes sense, then get with it What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison Undereducate their girls and boys and Split em up, make em fight one another Better yet, make em kill for a color All my brothers need to know one thing No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang  [Michel'le] Don't you know we've got to put our heads together? Stop the fighting (Make the change) Because we're all in the same gang  [Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren] Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying To stop it from falling apart and going to waste And keeping a smile off of white face N.W.A never preaching, just teaching The knowledge of the streets to each and All that don't understand, that's why we came To let you know that we're all in the same gang  [JJ Fad] The J double, F, the a, the d, that is And if you want the solution to the quiz What's black and black, yo, and kills another? An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother But another So now it's time we evolve And get together and solve it Cause the world is revolvin Around a terrible situation One will kill another for a reputation So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)  [Young MC] Brothers killin' other brothers I thought the idea was to love one another? Open up the paper to one more death If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left I try my best to set an example Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples Not just a brag or to boast but to inform Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm You see, I believe that the children are the future But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya? We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed And I want to see all young people succeed Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10 Just go to work and not the state pen Cause you live better when you're out there free And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC  [Digital Underground] I'm in a rage Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G? Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news We prove them suckers right and I got the blues America Get busy, Humpty The red, the white, the blue and The blue and the red For Crips and Bloods The white for who's got you doin Time bustin caps on one another The Underground's down for peace among brothers Kill a black man? What? Yo, what are you retarded? Tell em, Hump Yo, do you work for the Klan? Do what ya like Unless you like gangbangin Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin  [Oaktown's 3.5.7.] The gang that should hang is the one that contains The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind Now listen, get loose, it's unity time Yeah, yeah Peace is a presence that we all need The future's in our hands, in word and deed I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD We're 3.5.7. totally  [MC Hammer] Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9 All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip Hit the block about 12 on the tick The windows went down and the nines went click People started yellin, bodies started bailin Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence Peace in the hood and a moment of silence We got together not for ego or fame We got involved cause we're all in the same gang  [Eazy-E] Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong Now your mother's singing that sad song (My baby ain't never hurt nobody!) But he still got smoked at BeBe's party But you're not the first or the last You're nothin but a short story from the past You're dead now, not number one but a zero Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero  [Michel'le] Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
