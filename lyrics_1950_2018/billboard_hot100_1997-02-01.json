I was like, this is like a fucking election It is that You know what I am saying Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like\u2026  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? (You don't know) Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?  [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.] Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up Choppin' rocks overnight The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White We had to grow dreads to change our description Two cops is on the milk box missin' Show they toes, you know they got stepped on A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon Runnin' from the police, picture that Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack That's why I bust back, it don't phase me When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? (It's on me)  [Verse 2: 2Pac] But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts? Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes No hesitation in extermination of these snitches Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do? But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew And now media is tryna test me Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me Misery is all I see, that's my mind state My history with the police will shake the crime rate My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped He screamed \"Thug Life!\" and emptied the clip Got tired of runnin' from the police  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?  [Outro: 2Pac] They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast  [The Notorious B.I.G.] I was more shocked than anything You know what I'm sayin'? But I wasn't more shocked of him dying I was more shocked of him\u2026 Pac is a strong dude, yo I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, \"Again?\" you know what I'm sayin'? He always getting shot, or shot at He going to pull through this one again Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over You know what I'm sayin'? But when he, when he died, I was just like, \"whoa\", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by I mean, even though we was going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody You know what I'm sayin'? Because there ain't no coming back from that  ",
