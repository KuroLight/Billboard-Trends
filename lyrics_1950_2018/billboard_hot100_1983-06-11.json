It's only natural  Another Saturday, another date She would be ready but she's always make them wait In the hallway in anticipation He didn't know the night would end up in frustration He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek  Come dancing That's how they did it when I was just a kid And when they said come dancing My sister always did  My sister should have come in a midnight And my mum would always sit up and wait It always ended up in a big row When my sister used to get home late Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate  The day they knocked down the Palais My sister stood and cried The day they knocked down the Palais Part of my childhood died, just died  Now I'm grown up and playing in a band And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand My sister's married and she lives on an estate Her daughters go out now it's her turn to wait She knows they get away with things she never could But if I asked her I wonder if she would  Come dancing Come on sister have yourself a ball Don't be afraid to come dancing It's only natural  Come dancing Just like the Palais on a Saturday And all her friends will come dancing Where the big bands used to play  ",
