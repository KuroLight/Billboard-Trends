You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin' Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  ",
