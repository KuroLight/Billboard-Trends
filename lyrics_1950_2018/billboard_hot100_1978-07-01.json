How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time  Oh, baby, oh, baby  You don't even know what I'm talking about It's just your way, baby, that's what you say How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time How can, how can you be daylight and darkness at the same time  Ah, daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight Ooh hoo, darkness, darkness, darkness How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time Same time, same time, my baby Baby, at the same time  ",

Yeah!  Only one love in my life Only one love in my life I'm a ship on the open ocean Darling, you're my guiding light! Yeah!  You're my guiding light And you're the only love in my life  ",

[Chorus 2] Cheeseburger in paradise Medium rare with mustard'd be nice Heaven on earth with an onion slice I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise  [Bridge] I like mine with lettuce and tomato Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes Big kosher pickle and a cold draught beer Well, good god Almighty which way do I steer  [Chorus 3] For my cheeseburger in paradise Makin' the best of every virtue and vice Worth every damn bit of sacrifice To get a cheeseburger in paradise; To be a cheeseburger in paradise I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise  [Bridge]  ",
