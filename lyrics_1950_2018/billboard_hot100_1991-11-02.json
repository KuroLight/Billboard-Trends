(BM) Shake it! Don't break it! It took your momma nine months to make it Bend over and spread 'em, girl Show-w-w me those country pearls Play that button you know real quick Let me Blow Me A Freaky Kiss Girl, you know you look so cute Throwin' that Coochie the way you do!  Chorus  Verse 3 (FKI) Poppin' that Thang a dance for the ladies Straight from the South, into the 90's Freaky girls are the ones I like In G-strings in the middle of the night Smoke-filled stages, women in cages Guards at the door, armed with gauges As they dance and I get hot Keep throwin' that Body! Don't stop! (BM) I like the way you get the champagne glass It makes me wanna Blast Off Real Fast So come on, baby, and pop it quick I fall in love when you Can't Sit Girl, you don't know? You ain't heard? Messin' with me, you're gonna get served See, none of my Girls, they never complain So come on, baby, and pop that thang!  Chorus  Luke: Janet J, pop, that Coochie! Bu-bles, pop, that Coochie! Ma-donna, pop, that Coochie! Sandra-P, pop that stinky smelly Coochie, baby!   Chorus  Luke: BREAKDOWN!!  ",

Better yet stomp her Break out the 12-gauge and full of buckshot, pump her But I said, nah forget it, I'm a chill This girl need help, she's mentally ill She got to trip' and started spending my grip! So I just had to rip the pipe out' her lips She cried, \"Crawf, please gimme some money\" \"I promise I'll stop, please, come on Crawf honey!\" I felt sorry for the girl cuz she's being misused It was the crack and the devil, riding to abuse This relationship just ain't gonna last Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it But let me tell you one thing I'm not I'm not your [puppet]...

She said \"stop lyin'\" Her feelings were hurt, so she broke out cryin' I said baby you gotta help yourself Don't expect help from anyone else This relationship just ain't gonna last Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it But let me tell you one thing I'm not I'm not your [puppet]...
