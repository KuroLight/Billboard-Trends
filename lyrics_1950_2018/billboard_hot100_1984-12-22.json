I don't know where I am but I know I don't like it I open my mouth and out pops something spiteful Words are so cheap, but they can turn out expensive Words like conviction can turn into a sentence  I held your hands Rings but none on that finger We danced and danced But I was scared to go much further with it Just half a chance Make sure that one night you're here but Next night you're not It always leaves me searching for a little  Tenderness Where is the Tenderness Where is the Tenderness?  Whistling in the graveyard Calling up your girlfriend Just trying to make her understand You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand No question (so many questions) She's going to catch you out, boy It all seems so underhand Now she's the only thing that ever made You feel like a man, man, madman, madman  Tenderness Where is the Tenderness Tenderness Tenderness Where is it?  I held your hands Rings but none on that finger We danced and danced But I was scared to go much further with it Just half a chance Make sure that one night you're here but Next night you're not It always leaves me searching for a little  Tenderness Where is the Tenderness?
