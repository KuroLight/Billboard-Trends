Lee\" Now I don't mind 'em chopping wood And I don't care if the money's no good Just take what you need and leave the rest But they should never have taken the very best The night they drove old Dixie down And all the bells were ringin' The night they drove old Dixie down And all the people were singin' They went, \"Na, na, na\" Like my father before me, I'm a working man And like my brother before me, I took a rebel stand But he was just 18, proud and brave But a yankee laid him in his grave I swear by the blood below my feet You can't raise the Caine back up when he's in defeat The night they drove old Dixie down And all the bells were ringin' The night they drove old Dixie down And all the people were singin' They went, \"Na, na, na\"  ",
