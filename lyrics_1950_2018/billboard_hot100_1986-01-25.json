Is it East versus West or man against man? Can any nation stand alone?

Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you It's the paradox that drives us on It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone  [Chorus] 3x In the burning Heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire  In the burning Heart  ",
