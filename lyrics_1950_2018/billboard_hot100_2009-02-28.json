Sorry if I sound so filled with gloom You say you care and I know you do But this is from my experience And my conclusion only makes sense  Just cause I love you and you love me It doesn't mean that we're meant to be I can climb mountains, swim cross the seas But the most frightening thing is you and me  I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears (No I'm not) But I'm scared of loving you I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair (That's right) But I'm scared of loving you Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask? Why do we love love When love seems to hate us?  Most circumstances, I know my fate But in this love thing, I don't get the game Why does it feel like those who give in They only wind up losing a friend  Just cause I love you and you love me It doesn't mean that we'll ever be Fly cross the ocean, sing for the queen But the most frightening thing is you and me  I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears (No I'm not) But I'm scared of loving you I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair (That's right) But I'm scared of loving you Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask? Why do we love love When love seems to hate us?  I'm sure, though I'm not sure But if we never try, we'll never know It's better to have loved Than not to loved at all  Not trying is worse than to stumble and fall And if we do, I'd rather it be with you Cause at least there will be sweet memories Oh, I'm not scared  I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears (No I'm not) But I'm scared of loving you I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair (That's right) But I'm scared of loving you Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask? Why do we love love When love seems to hate us? Ooh ooh!  ",
