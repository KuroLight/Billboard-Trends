And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep Her window shades all pulled completely down  Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit Well this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites  No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA  ",

I met her in church I met her in church; we fell in love on a Sunday morning All at once, I heard angels singing, singing \"Hallelujah!\" Singing, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  I didn't find her on a Saturday night; I found her in the Sunday morning light I found her on a back row seat In a little church just down the street  I met her in church, and I wed her in church Preacher Jones said, \"Come here, children Good Lord willing, and the creek don't rise You're going to be happy for the rest of your life! Singing, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  I met her in church; I met her in church I found a love, I found a love! Hallelujah, I found a love\u2026 Right there in church, I found a love Singing, Hallelujah!  I met her in church; I met her in church Hallelujah!  ",
