Is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing Let's break out the booze and have a ball If that's all there is  And then I fell in love With the most wonderful boy in the world We'd take long walks down by the river Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes We were so very much in love Then one day he went away And I thought I'd die, but I didn't And when I didn't, I said to myself \"Is that all there is to love?\"  Is that all there is? is that all there is? If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep...  I know what you must be saying to yourselves \"If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?\" Oh, no.

Oh, yeah Now everybody, everybody's got it's own thing Everybody's got it's way of doing a thing Now we should attempt to do a tune that is very popular It was written by one of the great young songwriters of today Now, I don't know what he was thinking about or what inspired him to write this tune, but it's a deep tune There's a deep meaning to this tune, because it shows you what the power of love can do Now I should attempt to do it my way, my own interpretation of it Like I said, everybody's got it's own thing I'm gonna bring it on down to Soulsville Now I want you to bear along with me for a few minutes while I set it up Now I want your imagination I want you to travel with me Oh, come on, come on, come on  This young man was raised in the hills of Tennessee When he reached the age of maturity, he moved to the West Coast And he fell in love when he got out there to this young girl Aw, man, she was out of sight. She was bad And then they started dating and then the inevitable: became engaged and got married Mmmmmmm, hmmmmmm, hmmmm They were happily married. That's right they lived in L.A Aw, aw. The power of love was upon them But you see, girls, I don't mean to come down on you But this man loved this woman so...He can really say love is blind He can see no wrong. No, no, no He worked every day and sometimes he'd pull overtime, double time, triple time He bought everything this woman's heart desires Everything that he could wreak and streak He spent his last dime on women because he loved her And you know, girls, you can take love and kindness sometime for weakness, and she took it for granted She said, \"I got a fool and I know I got a fool, but I got a good thing.\" Yeah, she was standing on the corner, you understand, meeting with her friends She would go to the beauty salon, get her hair fixed She'd go shopping and she would brag about her good thing she's got Yeah. And she took doubt on it See, ain't nobody gonna believe what to tell him no way, fool Aw, yeah, girls, you would love that sometimes But one day, one day, the old boy got sick and he had to come home I don't have to tell you what he found Oh, yeah, it hurt him so bad He said, \"Baby...Mama, why?\" That's all he could say That's all he could say. He was hurt But she said, \"Aw. Go on fool, you're doing it, but the man wasn't doing it, but that's the only excuse you can give him.\" He said, \"Mama, I can't take it. I got to leave you. I'm gonna leave you.\" He packed his rags, you understand, and started out the door And when he reached the driveway, you understand, he went there begging just like Tyrone Davis And he said, \"Oh, Mama, Mama, Mama, can I change, oh, my mind.\" You see, the power of love was upon him and then he came back. Oh, yes he did When she tried to straighten up, she said she was gonna straighten up She got a little job to help him out with the bills too, but that was just a sham, because he found it again and again, and seven times he left this woman and seven times he came back Aw, but you know, the heart can take so much That's right. You can kick a dog around for so long and he'll get tired. He'll turn And he taken all that he could stand In the eighth time that this went down, he said, \"Mama, I got to go.\" With tears in his eyes, he said, \"I'm gonna leave you, baby.\" He said, \"I ain't coming back.\" He said, \"I'm leaving my heart right here, but I got to go, you see, cause this man can't take no more.\" She didn't believe it He packed his clothes He got in his 1965 Ford and started out Three times he started to turn back before he reached the outskirts of the city, but he kept on going Oh, I don't wanna go, but I got to leave you, Mama And he's going down on the highway I guess it was around 3:30 in the morning He could not hardly see the road with tears in his eyes That's right, he was crying They were meeting in his tears He could not hardly see the sign that went on the sign of the road It read the next town is 125 miles away And these very words came into his mind. He said...  By the time I get to Phoenix, she'll be rising Oh, she'll find a note I left hanging on the door She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leaving. Oh, yes she will. Why? Cause I left that girl so many times before. Oh  By the time I make Albuquerque, she'll be working And she'll probably stop at lunch just to give her, her sweet good thing a call And ohhh, she'll hear, oh, oh, the phone keeps right on ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing, oh, and ringing off the wall. Mama, Mama, that's all  And by the time I get to Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping She'll turn softly in her restless sleep, call my name out low And ohhhh, then she'll cry just to think I-I-I-I-I-I would really leave her But time after time after time and time and again I tried to tell her so But she wasn't a believer, oh, and she did know Oh, that I-I-I-I-I would really go She didn't believe I would really go. Oh no I hate to leave you, baby. Yes I do I really, really, really hate to go Oh yeah, but this heart of mine just can't take no more I-I-I-I-I-I-I've taken all that I could stand You should've known what you were doing to the man Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You see, when I left, baby, I left a good piece of my heart. Oh, yeah You know, you know, you know, you know you took, baby You know you...You know you took the greatest part. Oh, yeah I don't know how I'm gonna make it, oh no, but I got to go on I'm gonna miss all the sweet loving and the good times But the good times weren't as heavy, aw, as the bad times. Oh, yeah You really, really put the hurt on me. Yes you did I'm a prisoner of your love and I just--I just won't ever be free, oh no So it's bye-bye. Oh, Mama, Mama, bye-bye Oh, bye-bye. Oh, bye-bye, baby, bye-bye It's too late for you to cry You had a good thing, oh, and you abused it. Yes you did. Yes you did You had a good heart, oh, and you misused it. Oh, yeah You were sweet to me, yes you were But on the other hand, you were real cold, cold, cold, cold You just kept me, oh You kept me hanging on. Yes you did Oh, oh, you kept me hanging on You kept me begging, begging You kept me begging to do right You kept me pacing the floor at night. Oh yeah But I love you. God knows that I love you, baby Ahh, yeah. I'll always love you, yeah  (Instrumental break)  Raindrops of water meeting under my chin You can look at me and tell all the pain I'm in Aw, yeah.

I am yours, you are mine You are what you are You make it hard  Remember what we've said And done and felt about each other Oh babe, have mercy Don't let the past Remind us of what we are not now I am not dreaming I am yours, you are mine You are what you are You make it hard  {Bridge}  Tearing yourself away from me now You are free And I am crying This does not mean I don't love you I do, that's forever Yes and for always I am yours, you are mine You are what you are You make it hard  Something inside is telling me That I've got your secret Are you still listening? Fear is the lock and laughter the key To your heart And I love you I am yours, you are mine You are what you are And you make it hard And you make it hard And you make it hard And you make it hard  Part 2  Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon What have you got to lose? Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you What have you got to lose? Can I tell it like it is? Listen to me baby- It's my heart that's suffering It's a-dying- And that's what I have to lose  I've got an answer I'm going to fly away What have I got to lose? Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays? What have you got to lose?  {Bridge}  Part 3  Chestnut brown canary Ruby throated sparrow Sing a song, don't be long Thrill me to the marrow Voices of the angels Ring around the moonlight Asking me, said she's so free How can you catch the sparrow? Lacy, lilting lyrics, losing love lamenting Change my life, make it right Be my lady  Part 4 - {Coda}  \u00a1Que linda! Me la traiga a Cuba La reina de la Mar Caribe Quiero s\u00f3lo visitarla all\u00ed Y que triste que no puedo. \u00a1Vaya! O Va! O Va!  ",
