I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  [Bridge 1] It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?  [Classical guitar solo]  Alone again, naturally  [Verse 3] Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears  And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand, why the only man She had ever loved had been taken  Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken  And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally  ",

Cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this: \"Dance... dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look In the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a Woman gotta find a woman\". He'd go down to the lake where all the Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look Around and just reach in and grab one. \"Come here... come here\" He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there Wet and frightened. He said: \"Move... move\". She got up. She was a Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said: \"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!\".

Well, before you do anything rash Dig this  [Chorus] Everybody plays the fool sometime There's no exception to the rule Listen, baby It may be factual, may be cruel I ain't lying Everybody plays the fool  [Verse 1] Falling in love is such an easy thing to do And there's no guarantee that the one you love Is gonna love you  Oh, loving eyes, they cannot see A certain person could never be Love runs deeper than any ocean It clouds your mind with emotion  [Chorus] Everybody plays the fool sometime There's no exception to the rule Listen, baby It may be factual, may be cruel I wanna tell you that Everybody plays the fool  [Verse 2] How can you help it when the music starts to play And your ability to reason is swept away  Oh, heaven on earth is all you see You're out of touch with reality And now you cry, but when you do Next time around someone cries for you  [Chorus] Everybody plays the fool sometime They use your heart just like a tool Listen baby They never tell you so in school I wanna say it again Everybody plays the fool  Listen to me, baby Everybody plays the fool sometime (There's no exception to the rule) No exception to the rule It may be factual, may be cruel sometimes Everybody plays the fool  [Outro] Listen, listen, baby Everybody plays the fool  ",

Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two Look out your window I can see his light If we can sparkle he may land tonight Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright  [Chorus] There's a starman waiting in the sky He'd like to come and meet us But he thinks he'd blow our minds There's a starman waiting in the sky He's told us not to blow it Cause he knows it's all worthwhile He told me Let the children lose it Let the children use it Let all the children boogie Starman waiting in the sky He'd like to come and meet us But he thinks he'd blow our minds There's a starman waiting in the sky He's told us not to blow it Cause he knows it's all worthwhile He told me Let the children lose it Let the children use it Let all the children boogie  ",
