Dark lady played black magic 'Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  [Verse 2] She dealt two cards, a queen and a three And mumbled some words that were so strange to me And then she turned up a two-eyed jack My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black She said, \"The man you love is secretly true To someone else who is very close to you! My advice is that you leave this place Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!\"  [Chorus] Dark lady laughed and danced And lit the candles one by one; Danced to her gypsy music Till her brew was done... Dark lady played black magic Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  [Verse 3] So I ran home and crawled in my bed I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said Then I remembered her strange perfume And how I smelled it once in my own room So I snuck back and caught her with my man; Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand... The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor-- Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!  [Chorus fades out] Dark lady laughed and danced And lit the candles one by one; Danced to her gypsy music Til her brew was done... Dark lady played black magic Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  ",

There's a bed I'm keepin' empty for you There's a lot I know I got to prove Don't let a simple misunderstanding Be a mountain that we can't move Ooh, ooh, baby  One chain don't make no prison Two wrongs don't make no right One rain don't make no river One punch don't make no fight  One chain don't make no prison Two wrongs don't make no right One rain don't make no river One punch don't make no fight  ",
