Where do niggas go when we die? Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga That's why we go to thug mansion That's the only place where thugs get in free And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion  [Verse 1: 2Pac] A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you Picture me inside the misery of poverty No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on We found a finally spot to kick it Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's We still visualize places that we can roll in peace And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion  [Hook: Anthony Hamilton] Ain't no place I'd rather be Chillin' with homies and family Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky Ain't no place I'd rather be Only place that's right for me Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?

Where I was born Where I was raised Where I keep all my yesterdays Where I ran off cause I got mad And it came to blows with my old man Well I came back and settled down This is where they'll put me in the ground Yeah this is My town (Nana na na na) Yeah this is My town (Nana na na na) My town  There ain't much going on here since they closed the mill That Whistle still blows every day at noon A bunch of us still go down to the diner I wonder if that Interstates still coming through But come Sunday morning service at the Church of Christ Well there ain't an empty seat to be found And this is My town (Nana na na na) Yeah this is my town (Nana na na na) Where I was born Where I was raised Where I keep all my yesterdays Where I ran off cause I got mad And it came to blows with my old man Well I came back and settled down It's where they'll put me in the ground This is My town (Nana na na na) Yeah this is My town (Nana na na na) My town  Well I bought and painted up that rusty tractor You can't miss it It's sitting right there in our yard The County came and took that water tower And that's Jennie with a baby in the car Well we're off to Sunday service at the Church of Christ And if we want a seat we better leave right now And maybe later me and T-Roy will show you around, our town (Nana na na na) Yeah this is my town (Nana na na na) Yeah Where I was born Where I was raised Where I keep all my yesterdays Where I ran off cause I got mad And it came to blows with my old man Well I came back and settled down This is where they'll put me in the ground This is My town (Nana na na na) Yeah this is My town (Nana na na na) This is My town (Nana na na na) My town (My town) (Nana na na na) This is My town (Nana na na na) My town (Nana na na na) This is My town (Nana na na na)  ",

I used to support ya, I thought you'd appreciate Some of these things that I bought ya Shoes from Milan, Louis Vuitton Animals on back and jewels on your arm Mami, it's nothin to make moves with a Don Loon the Big Fish, leave them fools in the pond  [Verse: Toni Braxton] Just when I made up my mind I don't want you at all now You had your chance, you owned me What makes you wanna call now? Can you try and tell me What made you choose her as your friend? (Chose you as a friend, baby) Just when I think you've given up It's you again... All I can say  [Hook: Toni Braxton + (Pharrell Williams)] Farewell my lonely one Nothing else here can be done (So hit the freeway!) I don't ever wanna see you again You didn't do me right so So long, goodbye, goodnight (So hit the freeway!) Maybe in some other life I'll see you again  [Verse: Toni Braxton] I would have bet the Dow Jones if then compared to our fun, yeah Imagine how crushing it was for you say I was not the one (I didn't mean it girl, sorry bout that) My friends say I was in denial Defendin' you as a perfect friend Now new rumors have risen up (psst psst psst psst psst) It's you again... Now all I can say  [Hook - 2] Farewell my lonely one Nothing else that can be done (So hit the freeway!)

[Verse: Toni Braxton] Damn, it's been so long since I head your voice last summer To be honest it made me smile when I seen you number (Hey baby, you know I miss you, ha-ha) Baby tell me why I should reconsider being your friend Maybe some day in your dreams my love You could say, \"damn it's you again\" Now all I can say  [Hook - 3] Farewell my lonely one (Farewell) Nothing else can be done (So hit the freeway!) I don't ever wanna see you again (Don't wanna see you, again) You didn't do me right so (Do me right baby) So long, goodbye (bye bye) goodnight (So hit the freeway!)
