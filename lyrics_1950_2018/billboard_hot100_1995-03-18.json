That rates worse than PG Just bring your ass to where they got me So you can feel the hand of the dead body  Nigga don't believe that song That nigga's wrong Gangstas don't live that long  Nigga don't believe that song That nigga's wrong Gangstas don't live that long  So now they tryin' separation And sendin' black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation Tappin' into our conversation Saying, the message that they give bring forth or premeditation  So David's got a silver mag while listenin' to Brad David gets mad and kills his dad David Duke's got a shotgun So why you get upset 'cause I got one?  A tisket, a tasket, a nigga got his ass kicked Shot in the face by a cop, close casket An open and shut situation Cop gets got, they wanna blame it on my occupation  If you don't dig me then, nigga, you can sue me Because the shit that I be sayin' ain't worse than no western money Don't blame me, blame your man, Gotti So you can feel the hand of the dead body  Nigga don't believe that song That nigga's wrong Gangstas don't live that long  You best to free your mind Before I free my nine And stop fuckin' with the void in pop Or feel my hot rocks  Bang, bang, boom, boom, ping, ping, I'm the black White boys gat a magazine and don't know how to act I'll attack and make you vomit Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad  Do he got a brother, I'm it now I'm the illest Wanna kill this house, nigga, Don Cornelius Can you feel this?  You punk niggas make me sick Suckin' on the devil's dick Scared of revolution Need to start deuchin'  Houston is the place, I caught a case Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face But I bust two times to the gut To the Reverend, Calvin Butts, gotta pair of nuts?  I started this gangsta shit in '86 Now you dissin' me for publicity Isn't he a hoe to the third degree? Who me?  I'm a G who like to scrap a lot Down with Rap-A-Lot And I can't stop, won't stop  So fuck, Bill and Hillary Ice Cube, there ain't no killin' me Ice Cube, Scarface Droppin' on these sellin' out niggas, doing it like this  Nigga don't believe that song That nigga's wrong Gangstas don't live that long  ",
