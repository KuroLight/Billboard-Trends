Sweet child o' mine Oh! Oh! Oh, oh!

I thought I was being real good to you I treat you sweet, take you out at night But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls I took you for a cruise all around the world I treat you high-post but you play me close And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast  Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five So you could have the finer things in life Since you're the kind that's never satisfied  [Pre-Chorus] Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my heart to you You should be giving me your heart too, oh But you just keep on acting just like a fool You know it ain't cool  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] From fancy cars to diamond rings I've just about given you everything There's really not much I won't do for you I bought you twelve yellow roses and candy too I like to be up front and never play the back But the way you treat me girl is like a heart attack I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock  [Pre-Chorus] Oh-oh-oh, girl, as long as I've been giving my love to you You should be giving me your love too, oh But you just keep on acting just like a fool You know it ain't cool It just ain't cool (Hoo)  Don't be cruel I know, oh  [Verse 4] We used to hang out tough, just kicking around We discovered a love that had never been found You gave me your heart, I gave you my mind But a true love affair we could never find Although I want you bad I could let you go 'Cause there's a lot of girls out there that won't say no Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie I want you more than human eyes can see But you had to start illin', trying to make a killin' Thought about the dollars I make and you were willing To be with me, Bobby B But with a bad attitude I can't compete Now you know my name, now I know your game You want to be with me you got to be the same way That another girl would be, and if you wanna be with me  [Chorus]  ",
