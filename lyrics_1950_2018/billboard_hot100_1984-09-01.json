Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki (Shut up) Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki  [Verse 1: Cozmo D] Three words to the whack \"step yourself back\" 'Cause we're gettin' down, and ain't givin' no slack Like a Burger King with a sack of Big Macs We're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks One time, in your mind you see You gotta boogie to your best ability You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down And when you've funked enough, make sure you pass it around Come on, let's go to work We got what'll make your body jerk Make you throw your hands up in the air Shake your booty and scream, oh yeah 'Cause we are the Jam-On Crew And jammin' on it is how we do the do We'll funk you up until you boogie down So come on people check out the sound Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound Check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound, check out the sound  (Jam on it)  Say, don't ya hear the sound Jam-On is gettin' down  (Jam on it)  [Verse 2: Chilly B] Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Chilly B And I'm a surefire, pure blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC If you want the best, come put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree That I've got no flaws 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see 'Cause when I was a little baby boy, my mama gave me a brand new toy Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolemite Time went by, on this God's creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam-On Production Crew So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy Clean out your ears and you open your eyes If you wanna hear the music just come alive An if you don't know how get ready to learn Cause Cozmo's takin' his turn to burn  [Verse 3: Cozmo D] You take a C, an O and a Z Then you add M-O and a freaky D Add a funky beat, and then what do you see It's Cozmo D, yeah, baby, that's me I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet Without me rockin' it's incomplete So rock this y'all, rock that y'all Rock on and don't you dare stop You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact 'Cause the Jam-On Crew will rock your body right back Rock a steam locomotive right off the track And give the whole wide world a funk attack A to the beat y'all, get down Let me rock you to the rhythm of the funky sound From hill to hill, from sea to sea When Jam On's rockin' everybody screams (Jam on it) Jam on it Jam on and on, on and on it And if you're feelin' like you wanna dance all night Then go on ahead and flaunt it 'Cause jammin' on is what we do best It's what separates us from the rest And if you don't think our crew's down for real Let me tell you what happened to the man of steel (Say Superman had came to town to see who he could rock) (He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block) (His speakers were three stories high, with woofers made of steel) (And when we brought our set outside, he said) \"Hah, be for real!\" He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat I socialize with X-ray eyes, and the ladies think it's sweet (And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move) (And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove) (And just when he had pulled the crowd and swore he'd won the fight) We rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called \"Disco Kryptonite\" (Rock'em Cozmo!) Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, \"You rock so naturally\" I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real I'm Cozmo D from outer space I came to rock the human race I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong That's why the whole world is singin' this song  (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it As day turns to night and night turns to day Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it Jam all around and upside down Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound  [Chilly B] (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control With the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul (Jam on it) Jam on it I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it Get outta your seat and jam to the beat And don't you dare stop till early mornin'  Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it  (Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo) (You rocked it, that's the way you do it) (Yeah, like, did you see when he went in the corner) (And he started doin' this) (Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki) (Wikki-wikki-wikki-wikki)  (Ah, man, this is too funky for me) (I'm goin' home) (Hey, Mergatroid, let's go) (Hey, you fellas seen my sister Mergatroid?) (She was standin' over here just a minute ago) (Yeah, I think I saw her over there with Grand D) (He's rockin' the mic, you know) (Diggy dang diggy dang da dang dang da diggy diggy diggy dang dang) (Di-r-r-r-ggy dang diggy diggy)  Say, don't ya hear the sound Jam On is gettin' down  ",
