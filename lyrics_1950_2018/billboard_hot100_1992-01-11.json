(Rush) This is scaring me  [Pre-Chorus] Seems every time I try To rest my heart is when The rush is back again Maybe this time I'll Make it work somehow Guess I'm gonna find out now  [Chorus] I get a rush And it's love for sure What else can it be? Something beckons me And I go back for more Oh, such a rush running right to my head Can't pass love by What else can I do? Something tells me to Give it one more try  [Verse 2] I'm not gonna die if love passes me by It goes and comes around, I know So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do I will carry on wading through every day 'til love needs me Waiting for the rush to come and find me I still remember when love was an angel send It will be back again  [Pre-Chorus] I don't remember when, I can't remember how It's very different now, hey It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me True to the touch I get a rush  [Chorus] I get a rush And it's love for sure What else can it be? Something's calling me And I go back for more, hey hey It's such a rush running right to my head Can't pass love by What can I do? Something tells me to Give it one more try  [Break]  [Pre-Chorus] I don't remember when, I can't remember how It's very different now, hey It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me True to the touch I get a rush  [Chorus] I get a rush And it's love for sure What else can it be? Something beckons me And I go back for more Oh, such a rush running right to my head Can't pass love by What can I do? Something tells me to Give it one more try, yeah  ",

There's a whole other life Waiting to be lived when One day we're brave enough To talk with conviction of the heart  And down your streets I've walked alone As if my feet were not my own Such is the path I chose Doors I have opened and closed  I'm tired of living this life Fooling myself, believing we're right when I've never given love With any conviction of the heart  One with the earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe we'll survive If we only try  How long must we all wait to change This world bound in chains that we live in To know what it is to forgive and be forgiven?  Too many years of taking now Isn't it time to stop somehow? Air that's too angry to breathe Water our children can't drink  You've heard it Hundreds of times You say you're aware Believe, and you care But do you care enough Where's your conviction of the heart?  One with the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  With the Earth With the sky One with everything in life I believe it will start With conviction of the heart  One Earth One sky Only one world  Only one chance For one life When will live (With conviction of the heart)  One child One dream And only one life  Give her one chance For one life When will we live  Only one Earth Only one sky Only one world We've only got one chance To live in one life  I believe it's only gonna start When we begin with Some conviction of the heart  ",
