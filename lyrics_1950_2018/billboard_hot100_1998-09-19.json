[B-Real] People can't live without the herb man If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow In the backyard or inside with hydro To the kush plant brush in a tangerine dream Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen Cycles of weed are constantly grown Somebody give me the razor to cut clones I'd like to stop, but it feels so good Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood DEA, never wanna leave me alone But never ever ever gotta warrant for my home What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!) Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more Please don't follow me into the sun Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb  Chorus 1/2  [B-Real] Out from the lab, no need for rehab If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!) In my closet the weed is dried out Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop Get locked up and they close up my shop That's why I buy no weed from no one That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb The scientifical, mystical one Growin my crops with the rays of the sun Come one come all and see how it's done If you see the pigs there's no need to run Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb But you never know what be the outcome You see the photo in the album The weed is growin like my erection Look I never told you where I was from Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb  Chorus  Dr. Greenthumb Doctor, your Bulova plant needs special tending to Doctor, we need more oxygen we need more CO2 Doctor, Dr. Greenthumb you're needed Doctor, dahyahahahhh...
