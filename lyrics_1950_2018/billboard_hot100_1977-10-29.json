[Chorus]  You're an essay in glamour Please pardon the grammar But you're every schoolboy's dream You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided You're the best team, I've ever seen  And there have been, many affairs Many times I've, thought to leave But I bite my lip and turn around Cause you're the warmest thing, I've ever found  [Chorus]  ",

Why don't you take up with the baker's wife instead of me, fool!  Pack up your rubber duck I'd like to wish you luck Your funny cigarettes Your sixty-one cassettes Pack all your clothes away Your rubber hose away Your old-day-glos away You're moving out today  Pack up your dirty looks Your songs that have no hooks Your stacks of Modern Screen Your portrait of the Queen  Your mangy cat away Your baby fat away You're headed that-a-way You're moving out today  Pack up your fork and spoon Please leave my Lorna Doones Your map of Mozambique Your water bed that leaks  ",
