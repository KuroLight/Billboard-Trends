Just because you blessed with cash Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass So see the moral of the story is a woman need love The kind you so-called players never dreamed of You got to try love, can't buy love If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love  [Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)] Who do you love?

I don't know  [Verse 1: Nas] Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin' Imagine going to court with no trial Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters More conscious of the way we raise our daughters Days are shorter, nights are colder Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge If coke was cooked without the garbage We'd all have the top dollars Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers Just some thoughts for the mind I take a glimpse into time Watch the blimp read \"The World Is Mine\"  [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (imagine that) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times)  [Verse 2: Nas] The way to be, paradise like relaxin' Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon Armani Exchange deranged Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path The Villa house is for the crew, how we do Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches So many years of depression make me vision The better livin', type of place to raise kids in Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin' Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin' Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish Political prisoner set free, stress free No work release, purple M3's and jet skis Feel the wind breeze in West Indies I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities And reverse fiends to Willies It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa  [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (imagine that) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times)  [Bridge: Lauryn Hill] And then we'll walk right up to the sun Hand in hand We'll walk right up to the sun We won't land  [Verse 3: Nas] You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler \u2018Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich Still nobody want a nigga having shit If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit I push a Q-45 Infinit(i) It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies Strictly living longevity to the destiny I thought I'd never see, but reality struck Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?  [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (imagine that) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times) If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (imagine that) I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled I love 'em love 'em baby Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times)  [Outro: Lauryn Hill] If I ruled the world, if I ruled If I ruled, I'd free all my sons Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled If I ruled the world If I ruled the world I love 'em love 'em baby!!
