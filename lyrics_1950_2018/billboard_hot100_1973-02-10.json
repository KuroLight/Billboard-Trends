How you gonna keep from turning your life away?  No days you can borrow, no time you can buy No trust in tomorrow. It's a lie And I feel like I'm dippin' and divin' My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels I'm lost in this star car I'm drivin' But my air sole keeps pushin' big wheels My world is a constant confusion My mind is prepared to attack My past a persuasive illusion I'm watchin' the future it's black What do you know? You know just what you perceive What can you show? Nothing of what you believe And as you grow, each thread of life that you leave Will spin around your deeds and dictate your needs As you sell your soul and you sow your seeds And you wound yourself and your loved one bleed And your habits grow, and your conscience feeds On all that you thought you should be I never thought this could happen to me  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down Round and around the world you go Spinning through the lives of the people you know We all slow down How you gonna keep on turning from day to day? How you gonna keep from turning your life away? Oh..  I feel like a spinning top or a dreidel The spinning don't stop when you leave the cradle You just slow down  ",

Under the willow, we can have high times if you'll abide We can discover the wonders of nature rolling in the rushes down by the riverside  She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double. Pays my ticket when I speed  She comes skimmin' through rays of violet. She can wade in a drop of dew She don't come, and I don't follow. Waits backstage while I sing to you  Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm. Jump like a willys in four wheel drive She's a summer love for spring, fall, and winter. She can make happy any man alive  Sugar magnolia ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight, come on out singing; I'll walk you in the sunshine. Come on honey. Come along with me  She's got everything delightful. She's got everything I need: A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight. Lazing in the sunshine? Yes, indeed  Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is half way down... Sometimes when the night is dying, I take me out, and I wander around. I wander 'round  Sunshine daydream walking in the tall trees, going where the wind goes Blooming like a red rose, breathing more freely Ride our singin'; I'll walk you in the morning sunshine Sunshine daydream, Sunshine daydream walking in the sunshine  ",
