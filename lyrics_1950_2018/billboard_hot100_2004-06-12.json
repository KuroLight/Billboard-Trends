Say goodbye Run away Why you cry-y-y For the guy-y-y? Say goodbye I said ok, 'cause  [Chorus: All] Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head? Because I do boy And it's cool boy And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed Because of you boy Such a fool boy  [Verse 2: Heidi (Mutya)] Eleven hours on a brand new day I'm getting ready to go out and play It's late at night, I'm caught in a groove I'll kiss my ass before I'm feeling blue  Seven hours, what you calling for? A bunch of flowers and I'll slam the door You're in my face, sorry what's your name? Takes more than begging to reverse my brain 'Cause  [Chorus: All] Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head Because I do boy And it's cool boy And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed Because of you boy Such a fool boy  [Middle 8: Keisha] I'm through with it Over it Not having it Crazy shit Not feeling this Can't deal, I quit No more, No more I'm through with it Not having it This crazy shit Not feeling it Can't deal with it No more, I quit No more, no more  Breaking off the bun A brand new day has just begun Just because you made me go \"ooh\" Doesn't mean I'll put up with you Don't you dare turn back Can't you see I won't take that? I ain't crying over you Better fill your head up like I told you  [Bridge: All] Why you cry-y-y For the guy-y-y? Say goodbye Run away Why you cry-y-y For the guy-y-y? Say goodbye I said ok, 'cause  [Chorus: All (with ad-libs from Keisha and Heidi)] Ooh, boy d'you miss me like a hole in the head Because I do boy And it's cool boy And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed Because of you boy Such a fool boy (such a fool)  Ooh, boy you miss me like a hole in the head (hole in the head) Because I do boy (I do) And it's cool boy (yeah it's cool) And ooh, bet you never thought I'd get out of bed Because of you boy, (get out bed, I do boy) Such a fool boy (such a fool)  [Outro: All] Run away I said ok, cuz...

She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time And your Gucci boots the same color as mine If you read between the lines you can see that I want you I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy  [Chorus: Joe] I wanna get to know ya I really wanna thug you, baby One dose of your loving I know it gon' drive me, crazy I wanna be your lover I wanna get to know you, baby One dose of my loving I know it gon' drive you, crazy  [Verse 2: Lloyd Banks] Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady I admit I fell in love with her frame And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain? Surrounding me, hounding me, tryin to be my ON-LY I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MEY  [Chorus: Joe] I wanna get to know ya I really wanna thug you, baby One dose of your loving I know it gon' drive me, crazy I wanna be your lover I wanna get to know you, baby One dose of my loving I know it gon' drive you, crazy  [Verse 3: 50 Cent] Yeah.. Don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man I sweet talk her if she like Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right? Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!) Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you All you gotta do is love me and be loyal Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me Let me ride on you, and you can ride on We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight  [Chorus: Joe] I wanna get to know ya I really wanna thug you, baby One dose of your loving I know it gon' drive me, crazy I wanna be your lover I wanna get to know you, baby One dose of my loving I know it gon' drive you, crazy I wanna get to know ya I really wanna thug you, baby One dose of your loving I know it gon' drive me, crazy I wanna be your lover I wanna get to know you, baby One dose of my loving I know it gon' drive you, crazy  [Outro: Joe] I wanna be your lover (oh yeah) I wanna understand you, baby I wanna be your lover I wanna understand you, baby...
