Probably not That didn't stop him From wishing that he did Didn't keep him from wanting Or worshipping him He guesses he saw him About once a year He could still feel the way he felt Standing in tears Stretching his arms out As far as they'd go Whispering dad I want you to know  CHORUS: I love you this much And I'm waiting on you To make up your mind Do you love me too? How ever long it takes I'm never giving up No matter what I love you this much  He grew to hate him for what he had done 'Cause what kind of father Could do that to his son? He said 'damn you daddy' The day that he died The man didn't blink But the little boy cried  CHORUS  Half way through the service While the choir sang the hymn He looked up above the preacher And he sat and stared at him He said 'Forgive me father' When he realized That he hadn't been unloved Or alone all his life His arms were stretched out As far as they go Nailed to the cross For the whole world to know  CHORUS  ",
