Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye It goes running through your soul Like the stories told of old  Old man, he and his dog They walk the old land Every flower touched his cold hand As he slowly walked by Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy  Feels so good Feels so good, it's frightening Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da la da da da........  Mysteries like this and Many others in the trees Blow in the night in the Southern skies  Southern nights They feel so good, it's frightening Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da........

Today the landlady, she said to me \"Your lonely friend just made a pass at me\" Perhaps you might enjoy a cottage by the sea So pack your toys away Your pretty boys away Your forty-fives away Your alibis away Your silly lies away Your old tie-dyes away Your one more tries away You're moving out today Your nasty habits aren't confined to bed The grocer told me what you do with bread Why don't you take up with the Baker's wife instead of me? Pack up your rubber duck I'd like to wish you luck Your funny cigarettes Your sixty-one cassettes Pack all your clothes away Your rubber hose away Your old day glows away You're movin' out today I hate to do it You gotta I hate to do it You gotta Hate to do it You gotta Hate to do it You gotta You gotta You gotta Pack up you dirty looks Your songs that have no hooks Your stacks of Modern Screen Your portrait of the queen Your mangy cat away Your baby fat away You're headed that away You're moving out today Pack up your fork and spoon But leave my Lorna Doones Your map of Mozambique Your water bed that leaks La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la The reason I'm singing la la is Because I'm so happy you're going Gosh, you've made me miserable I don't think I've ever been so unhappy As I've been this last year with you You are really a dirty, dirty guy Did anyone ever tell you that? Oh, uh, by the way, would you Uh, take off that coat you're wearing? That's my coat you're wearing Ah, yes, thank you, oh, goodbye Parting is such sweet sorrow  ",

Say you'll stay untill tomorrow I can't face tonight alone Though I know it's over and we're through Say you'll stay untill tomorrow I need you  I've known for some time now That thing's just ain't been right Cause when we try to talk We both get so uptight But now you've told the truth And I know where I stand Though it hurts (though it hurts) Deep inside (deep inside) Give me time (give me time) I'll get by so...  Say you'll stay untill tomorrow I can't face tonight alone Though I know it's over and we're through Say you'll stay untill tomorrow I need you Though I know it over and we're through Say you'll stay untill tomorrow I neeeeeeeeedddd you  ",
