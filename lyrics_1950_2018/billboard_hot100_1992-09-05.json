Damn, how could this happen?  Now St. Louis Yeah y'all, St. Louis  [Verse 3: DJ Quik] I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good They need to stop watchin that \"Colors\" and \"Boyz in the Hood\" Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw And never ever seen the Shaw But now, back to the story that I'm tellin We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits When I'm thinkin bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest And San Antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test And before it was over the shit got deep A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin' Little did they know that we was packin' Yeah, we was puttin' em down and scaring the rest, yo I even had to wear the bulletproof vest  Now San Antonio Yeah, San Antonio  [Verse 4: DJ Quik] After a month on the road We came home and I can safely say That L.A. is a much better place to stay How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this Have such a big influence on niggas so far away? But still my story ain't over cuz I got one more to tell And the people of Colorado, they know it well It was all in the news and if you don't remember I had this show I did in Denver With a punk ass promoter, in a bunk ass skatin rink Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my Guess When it was over two niggas needed stitches Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches  Now Denver Yeah, y'all Denver  I thought ya knew  ",

All Berlin walls must fall The physical torture and mental oppression The anguish of depression Life is a lesson That you've got to study hard because the hard times Are grippin' and whippin' Quit slippin' Don't be a slave just create a positive state Don't break just make and take Be great Don't be controlled just be strong never doubt your tomorrow And we'll hear you scream out...  [Hook: Me Phi Me & Michael Franks] SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY! SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!  [Verse 2: Me Phi Me] When it rains it pours For pain is a force Let happiness be your source and keep goin' for yours I know old Dante pulled you in The Inferno But pain you learn though is not eternal So now you're in the dungeon, on the wall you hang You try everything, the pendulum still swings You're down on your knees and prayin' Oh My GOD Tell me why this life has to be so hard Is it all in the cards? Yeah, deal me a new one And maybe life won't be so lonely and gruesome But I'ma tell you son -- before you begin Even with a bad hand, you can bluff and win So put your chips on the table you're able to do the task Unmask the executioner and take his axe And break the chains that bind and confine your mind this is your time Unleash and unwind put pain behind Climb out of the pit of darkness and start this new breed For this is what we need Don't be held down and hellbound be strong and profound Unfasten the leather that's strappin' you down Dig down and get up and you'll be swingin' the soul sound A New Day is coming, the sun don't frown Don't conform be confined or obey Nelson Mandela breathes the air of a New Day So now you're a number in the prison of a hardened soul But be brave and behave and you may get parole So there's HOPE, and hope is a pleasant thing Over the horizon I see the sun, I hear you sing...  [Hook] SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY! SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY! SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY! SAD NEW DAY, GO AWAY!   [Verse 3: Me Phi Me] Solar energy within ME all through ME It's the sun full of light bringing power and might All right makin' everything start to swing You be the king or queen of your own dream Life can be supreme, it's a special thing Just keep the faith through the night time You operate smooth and you might find All of the loving, the bliss, the joy -- a happy deal Friendship and jubilee, you live The Elysian fields For real -- you need to feel unchained and free Into the ME PHI ME And you are in the rat race, so put an your gym shoes Run emphatically, step on them blues Choose the right path and be on your way And you'll be able to say What a wonderful life!
