Oh my Lord So praise the Lord But they were lost without you They needed you so bad His light is shining on us  Oh my Lord, oh my Lord So praise the Lord With the Child's adoration Oh my Lord oh my Lord He is a personation There came great jubilation Oh my Lord So praise the Lord That sin may not enslave us  ",
