        "lyrics": "  In 1814 we took a little trip Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip We took a little bacon and we took a little beans And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they begin to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico (One-two-three, with a-one-two-three)  We looked down a river (Hut-two) And we see'd the British come (Three-four) And there must have been a hundred of'em (Hut-two) Beatin' on the drums (Three-four) They stepped so high (Hut-two) And they made their bugles ring (Three-four) We stood beside our cotton bales (Hut-two) And didn't say a thing (Two-three-four)  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they begin to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico  Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise (One-hut, two-three-four) If we didn't fire our muskets (One-hut, two-three-four) 'Till we looked 'em in the eye (One-hut, two-three-four) We held our fire (Hut, two-three-four) 'Till we see'd their faces well Then we opened up our squirrel guns And really gave 'em - well we  Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they begin to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico  Yeah, they ran through the briars (One-hup-two) And they ran through the brambles (Hup-two-three-four) And they ran through the bushes (Hup-two) Where the rabbit couldn't go (Hup-two-three-four) They ran so fast (Hup-two) That the hounds couldn't catch 'em (One-two-three-four) On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico (One-two, hup-two-three-four)  We fired our cannon 'til the barrel melted down So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round We filled his head with cannon balls, and powdered his behind And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind  We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they begin to runnin' On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico  Yeah, they ran through the briars (Hup-one-two) And they ran through the brambles (One-two-three-four) And they ran through the bushes (Hup-two) Where the rabbit couldn't go (Hup-two-three-four) They ran so fast (Hup-two) That the hounds couldn't catch 'em (One-two-three-four) On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico  Songwriter:  Jimmy Driftwood  ",

[Bridge] That's when I knew that the hangin' tree Was a tree of life, new life for me A tree of hope, new hope for me A tree of love, new love for me The hangin' tree, the hangin' tree, the hangin' tree!
