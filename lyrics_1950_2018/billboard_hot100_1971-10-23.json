[Repeat Chorus] I could feel hot flames Of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared But soon she returned  In her hand was a bottle of wine And in the other, a glass Good god  She poured some of that wine From the bottle into the glass And she raised it to her lip And before she drank it, she said...

Here on the street I got six on each arm and two more round my feet  Life is a carnival, believe it or not Life is a carnival, two bits a shot  Saw a man with the jinx in the third degree From trying to deal with people, people you can't see Take away, take away, this house of mirrors Give away, give away, all the souvenirs  We're all in the same boat ready to float off the edge of the world The flat old world The street is a sideshow from the peddler to the corner girl  Life is a carnival, it's in the book Life is a carnival, take another look  Hey, buddy, would you like to buy a watch real cheap? Here on the street I got six on each arm and two more round my feet  Life is a carnival, believe it or not Life is a carnival, two bits a shot  Life is a carnival Life is a carnival Life is a carnival  ",

Some men follow rainbows I am told Some men search for silver, some for gold But I have found my treasure in your soul My honey, all I ever need is you...  Without our love, I'd never find the way Through ups and downs of every single day I won't sleep at night until you say, my Honey All I ever need is you  ",
