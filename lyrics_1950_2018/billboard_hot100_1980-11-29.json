In the dead of night She could shine a light On some places that you've never been In that kind of light You could lose your sight And believe there was something to win You could hold her tight With all your might But she'd slip through your arms like the wind And be back in flight Back into the night Where you might never see her again  The longer I thought I might find her The shorter my vision became Running in circles behind her And thinking in terms of the blame But she couldn't have been any kinder If she'd come back and tried to explain She wasn't much good a saying goodbye--but That girl could sing  ",

I'm so pale and weak Rough fits In my Hush Puppy shoes But I'm still pleading Pleading, bleeding, fining, whining, shining  I wanna see what I can find  Tough boys Running the streets Come a little closer Rough toys Under the sheets Nobody knows her Rough boys Don't you walk away I very nearly missed you Tough boys Come over here I wanna bite and kiss you  I wanna see what I can find  ",
