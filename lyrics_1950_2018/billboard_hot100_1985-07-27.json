I say  Black cars look better in the shade She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps For all those phantom lovers in her dreams  She smokes them french cigarettes In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress She cuts a perfect silhouette  But she's a dark angel wearing dark glasses A fading beauty as the night time passes ...
