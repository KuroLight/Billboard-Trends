Two ghetto birds die Before we learn to fly Somebody else can say I'm pokin guns, smokin weed Can all make the change so I'm told but I haven't seen a change unfold I keep hopin, please! If you prefer to breath Communities in need, of people that we lead Keep your eyes open now, then only say I try Until the day I die, I promised to be wise With my heart open, greed, brings only misery A weight of tragedy, so I stay sucker free Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die For the thought of hopen wise, my brothers speak wise They focus on the prize, till everybody dies  (Part 2: Eminem) We could only learn to take, our anger and our hate Control our mental state, settle down and just set it straight Maybe we could learn to take, a second to pump the brakes But we said it, regret it later, and let it escalade Cuz by then its just too late, there is so much we can take Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate Till the point that he just breaks, snaps and that's all it takes You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes But we ain't, his brain will go against With every artist comes an image he portrays And a picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this gangs Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangsta And I ain't hear no complaints But I know, that I will always continue to grow As long as I lead, and never follow no one else's shadow There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee Its that why I remain sucker free, to this day The game, will never be the same No matter how much fame or success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do, there will never be another you You can search but you'll never find You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds We will never die, we are forever alive When we continue going, one day at a time  (Part 3: Outlawz #1) Don't get caught in the publicity, and caught in the hype Rappers are, regular people minus money and lights Searchin for, fortune and fame and super stardom All the jewelry, all the cars, who screws the hardest Now the Hip Hop Police's surveillance is watchin And the kids think beef is their only option Outlawz, poor and filthy, guilty as charged My memories they can die, my -Makaveli- lives on You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap We needin a change, the drama remains  (Part 4: Outlawz #2) I spend my whole life,(yeah) fightin myself That, I can't win, so I'm invitin some help And every now and then, I take rights on the left I'm still just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt That day is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope God take a light to myself No matter how much I try to stay alive, I'mma die, mad Still standin and in love with my pride  (Part 5: Outlawz #3) My hard frivilous beef, we passed that I'm tryna keep some in c-comin and then collect on my ass cap But rappers in the game ain't changed And I finally realized that we not in the same game The hatin will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it Them 4-5 a cop, chillers just I'm still with it Them streets is military, you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay lirry and keep your eyes on the Rollers They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do it, we gotta do to keep growin One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind When we continue growin, one day at a time (Damn!)
