Did you really buy him all those cars And the clothes like you said on the record? Yeah, love'll make you do these things  It's a funny thing how these men Can make you lie in bed night after night Wondering if they coming home Laying there by the phone  Hoping that any minute he'll call And tell you, baby, I'll be there shortly You just hold on, I'm coming  Comes in three days later, yeah I know you know what I'm talking about You see, it ain't no fun to have to sit there And count the tile on the floor Count them four walls  And another funny thing How we ladies can get on that telephone Talking day after day about how sweet And how good our love life is  You might be familiar with this Commercial that comes on TV How's your love life? Knowing all the time that it's rotten Ha ha, having to laugh to keep from crying Ha ha ha, like I'm doing now  But you see, the only thing I've always believed in Whatever makes me feel happy I try to do whatever it takes To keep it that way  But you see, it ain't no fun Being in love all by yourself Knowing all the time that the one you love Is loving somebody else I'm standing here to tell you today, ladies That it ain't no fun  It ain't no fun Being in love all by yourself No, it ain't no fun When the one you love loves someone else  It ain't no fun, no, it ain't Being in love all by yourself No, no, no, oh, no, oh, oh, oh  ",
