Didn't know what happened But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap  I come to and my brother was there And he said, \"What's wrong with your eyes?\" I said, \"I don't know, I was chewing on a weed\" He said, \"Let me give it a try\" We spent the rest of that day and most of that night Trying to find my brother, Bill Caught up with him, 'bout six o'clock the next morning Naked, singing on the wind mill! He said he flew up there I had to fly up there and bring him down He was about half crazy  The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds And put 'em in the sun to dry Then we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up And put 'em in the corncob pipe Smokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit We didn't see no harm We thought it was kind of handy Take a trip and never leave the farm!
