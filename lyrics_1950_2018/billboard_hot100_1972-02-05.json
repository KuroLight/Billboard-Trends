        "lyrics": "  [Verse 1] A long, long time ago... I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And, maybe, they\u2019d be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I\u2019d deliver Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn\u2019t take one more step I can\u2019t remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died  [Chorus] So bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 2] Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock \u2019n' roll Can music save your mortal soul And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you\u2019re in love with him `cause I saw you dancin\u2019 in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin\u2019 buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 3] Now for ten years we\u2019ve been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin\u2019 stone But that\u2019s not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned; No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 4] Helter skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and falling fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance! `cause the players tried to take the field; The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singing  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 5] Oh, and there we were all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on: Jack be nimble, Jack be quick! Jack Flash sat on a candlestick Cause fire is the devil\u2019s only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan\u2019s spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singing  [Chorus] Bye-bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\"  [Verse 6] I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I\u2019d heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn\u2019t play And in the streets: the children screamed The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken; The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most: The father, son, and the holy ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singing  [Deleted Verse] And there I stood alone and afraid I dropped to my knees and there I prayed And I promised him everything I could give If only he would make the music live And he promised it would live once more But this time one would equal four And in five years four had come to mourn And the music was reborn  [Chorus] Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die.\" They were singing Bye, bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singing, \"This\u2019ll be the day that I die\"  ",

Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down Put it in a song kinda circulate it around Can't ever tell it might make a hit And that redneck Hall did a little bit Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!

And with that little bit of wisdom I took another puff  I took a puff, and then a puff, then I finally ripped off another puff And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough Besides I'd just about had enough I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway  Oh I think they ought to take it offa television It looks too good! Ow! I like them skinny ones with the filter Oh give it to me! Give it to me! Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
