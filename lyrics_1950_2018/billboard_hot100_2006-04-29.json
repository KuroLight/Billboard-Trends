[Chorus] The whole world World over It's a worldwide suicide  [Verse 2] Medals on a wooden mantle, next to a handsome face That the president took for granted Writing checks that others pay And in all the madness Thought becomes numb and naive So much to talk about, nothing for to say It's the same everyday and the wave won't break Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder Laying claim to the take that our soldiers save Does not equate, and the truth's already out there  [Chorus][x2]  [Verse 3] Looking in the eyes of the fallen You got to know there's another, another, another, another Another way It's a shame to awake in a world of pain What does it mean when a war has taken over It's the same everyday and the wave won't break Tell you to pray, while the devils on their shoulder  [Chorus][x2]  ",
