You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  ",

I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong All caught up in the eye of the storm And trying to figure out what it's like moving on  And I don't even know what kind of things I said My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin The hardest part of ending is starting again  [Outro: Chester & Mike] All I want to do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  This is not the end, this is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision I'm holding on to what I haven't got But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm Though the words sound steady Something empty's within them  We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear Holding on to what I haven't got Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear  ",

You lost the love I loved the most  [Pre-Chorus] I learned to live, half alive And now you want me one more time  [Chorus 1] And who do you think you are? Runnin' 'round leaving scars Collecting your jar of hearts And tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold From the ice inside your soul So don't come back for me Who do you think you are?  [Verse 2] I hear you're asking all around If I am anywhere to be found But I have grown too strong To ever fall back in your arms  [Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus 1]  [Verse 3] It took so long just to feel alright Remember how to put back the light in my eyes I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed \u2018Cause you broke all your promises And now you're back You don't get to get me back  [Chorus 2]x2 And who do you think you are? Runnin' 'round leaving scars Collecting your jar of hearts And tearing love apart You're gonna catch a cold From the ice inside your soul Don't come back for me Don't come back at all  [Outro] Who do you think you are?
