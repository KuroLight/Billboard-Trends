Do you believe in love? And if they taste the same Would you love again or abandon both?  I don't think I ever can Belive my friend has gone Keep saying it's alright I'm going to bring you back But I know I'm wrong  There's nothing I can say There's nothing left to do It's just that lately I feel so damn lonely When I think of you  And it may seem selfish now But I'll hold on to the memory Until all this fear is washed away Do you believe in love?
