[Verse 1: Doitall] Born with the fuckers from the womb of Brenda She now likes the Lords but she used to dig the Spinners First with the style from the birth canal And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild So dig it, wahh! Ooh, watch me dig it I'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget I tax the peace more than chicken packs grease I'm nearly knockin' boots, but if not, I'll knock teeth Wahh! Ga ga, ooh, cries the baby Smacked on the ass, now the Doitall's crazy No rattles, or playpens, or crowds when I'm rappin' And yes, I do reruns, as if this was What's Happening Now January 14 has birthed the funk one The B-Day for Dupree, and yes, I'm funky I got you bobbin' to the funky style K-Def, let 'em know here comes the funky child  [K-Def] Yeah... (laughs) born in the underground of Newark Now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee  [Verse 2: Mr. Funkee] The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger A.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funkee Wallbanger Conceived in the fire by a war through disasters The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters Mr. Funkee, yes, girl, the black mack is back Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that You can work day and night, you could practice all your life But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!) When I was young I used to sing with my sister (Heyy) Now I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild Raised in the ways of the funky child  [Verse 4: Doitall] Back up baby, here comes the stroller We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla I'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum Distributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic Marley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like POW! Now it's time to get buckwild And watch my funky brothers freak the underground In a second, or minute, in no times flat... ... Bring it back! And go grab the album to bring the Lords money Take it home to mom to say, \"Ain't they funky?\"  [Verse 5: Mr. Funkee] We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS It didn\u2019t affect me, I said, \"So what?\" I kept on writing rhymes I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on!) Don't worry not for other crews selling out As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business You might say, \"Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out!\" But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about Any props you receive are the props that you earn I'm off 'til the funky child returns  ",

They must've thought I was a bank, cuz I wear Gucci links Come on girls askin' for things, oh boy I had to dip I mean I can't believe it, but the females they trip  Chorus  Third Verse: Every guy wants to know why girls do what they do Us fellas can't get over without them askin' you For somethin' to eat, somethin' to wear, get their hair done When they approach askin' for somethin', you wanna run Gold here, gold there, gold everywhere Piled up on the chick with the weave in her hair This song is for the guys, so I hope that you listen Don't let ANY girl, fool you on a gold mission  ",
