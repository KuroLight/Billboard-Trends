She's so far gone she feels just like a fool My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things You set it up so well, so carefully Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things You're still the same old girl you used to be  [Chorus] You can't hide your lying eyes And your smile is a thin disguise I thought by now you'd realize There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes There ain't no way to hide your lying eyes Honey, you can't hide your lying eyes  ",

        "lyrics": "  Pleasure's the motivation for the human race Everything starts and ends with sex and appeal Feeling good is the bait, Satan uses to fish for you and me Comfort is the poison when it's the spirit he wants to kill  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  There's such a need for us to feel nice and it's getting better We got to have it more than we ought to The preacher keeps promisin' satisfaction The ladies keep giving up the gratifaction You know what? I'm feeling better by the pound  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  You know what? I'm feeling better by the pound I'm feeling better by the pound  Joyful is the hocus pocus that's haunting all mankind Said he couldn't be what he needs to be you see He and only he is free Well, he who is truly free Say, free from the need to be free  There's a tidal wave of mysticism Surging through our jet-aged generation It's all designed to take us to the sky  ",
