bang bang The boogie to the boogie the beat I said I can't wait 'til the end of the week When I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat An attempt to raise your body heat Just blow your mind so that you can't speak To do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet And let it change up to a dance called the freak And when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat Rest a little while so ya don't get weak I know a man named Hank He has more rhymes than a serious bank So come on Hank, uh, sing that song To the rhythm of the boogie the bang bang the bong  [Verse 6: Big Bank Hank] Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp The women fight for my delight But I'm the grandmaster with the three emcees That shock the house for the young ladies And when you come inside, into the front You do the freak, spank, and do the bump And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint A from sun to sun and from day to day I sit down and write a brand new rhyme Because they say that miracles never cease I've created a devastating masterpiece I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist Everybody, I say it goes like this Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon Reporter stopped me for a interview She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables This young reporter I did adore So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before She said \"damn fly guy I'm in love with you\" The Casanova legend must have been true I said by the way baby what's your name Said \"I go by the name of Lois Lane\" And you could be my boyfriend you surely can Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman I said he's a fairy I do suppose Flying through the air in pantyhose He may be very sexy or even cute But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit I said you need a man who's got finesse And his whole name across his chest He may be able to fly all through the night But can he rock a party 'til the early light He can't satisfy you with his little worm But I can bust you out with my super sperm I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere Just throw your hands up in the air And party hardy like you just don't care Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop I go: Hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (say what) I'm gonna get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn You see, if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend I say skip, dive, what can I say I can't fit em all inside my OJ So I just take half and bust them out I give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house  [Verse 7: Master Gee] It was twelve o'clock one Friday night I was rocking to the beat and feeling all right Everybody was dancing on the floor Doing all the things they never did before And then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean She came into the bar, she came into the scene As she traveled deeper inside the room All the fellas checked out her white Sassons She came up to the table, looked into my eyes Then she turned around and shook her behind So I said to myself, its time for me to release My vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece And now people in the house this is just for you A little rap to make you boogaloo Now the group ya hear is called phase two And let me tell ya something we're a helluva crew Once a week we're on the street Just a-cutting the jams and making it free For you to party, got to have the moves So we'll get right down and give you a groove For you to dance you got to be hype So we'll get right down for you tonight Now the system's on and the girls are there You definitely have a rocking affair But let me tell ya something there's still one fact That to have a party ya got to have a rap So when the party's over, you're making it home And trying to sleep before the break of dawn And while ya sleeping you start to dream And thinking how ya danced on the disco scene A name appears in your mind Yeah, a name you know that was right on time It was phase two just a doing a do Rocking ya down cause ya know we could To the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak Come alive girls get on your feet To the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat To the double beat beat that it makes ya freak To the rhythm of the beat that says you go on On and on into the break of dawn Now I got a man coming on right now He's guaranteed to throw down He goes by the name of Wonder Mike Come on Wonder Mike do what ya like  [Verse 8: Wonder Mike] Like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey Like a millionaire that has no money Like a rainy day that is not wet Like a gambling fiend that does not bet Like Dracula with out his fangs Like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang Like collard greens that don't taste good Like a tree that's not made out of wood Like going up and not coming down Is just like the beat without the sound, no sound To the beat beat, ya do the freak Everybody just rock and dance to the beat Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat And the food just ain't no good I mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed And the chicken tastes like wood So you try to play it off like you think you can By saying that you're full And then your friend says \"momma he's just being polite He ain't finished uh-uh that's bull\" So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie And you say that you already ate And your friend says \"man there's plenty of food\" So you pile some more on your plate While the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming Of the moment that it's time to leave And then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting Into something that looks like cheese Oh so you say that's it I got to leave this place I don't care what these people think I'm just sitting here making myself nauseous With this ugly food that stinks So you bust out the door while its still closed Still sick from the food you ate And then you run to the store for quick relief From a bottle of kaopectate And then you call your friend two weeks later To see how he has been And he says \"I understand about the food Baby but bubbah we're still friends\" With a hip hop the hippie, to the hippie The hip hip a hop a you don't stop the rocking To the bang bang boogie Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat I say \"Hank can ya rock? Can ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop? Can ya hip me to the shoobie doo\" I said \"come on, make uh, make the people move\"  [Verse 9: Big Bank Hank] I go to the halls and then ring the bell Because I am the man with the clientele And if ya ask me why I rock so well I'm big bang, I got clientele And from the time I was only six years old I never forgot what I was told It was the best advice that I ever had It came from my wise dear old dad He said \"sit down punk I wanna talk to you And don't say a word until I'm through Now there's a time to laugh a time to cry A time to live and a time to die A time to break and a time to chill To act civilized or act real ill But whatever ya do in your lifetime Ya never let a MC steal your rhyme\" So from six to six 'til this very day Ill always remember what he had to say So when the sucker emcees try to chump my style I let them know that I'm versatile I got style, finesse and a little black book That's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look But there's a thing that separates you from me And that is called originality Because my rhymes are on from what you heard I didn't even bite and not a godd--m word And I say a little more later on tonight So the sucker emcees can bite all night Uh, tick a tock y'all, a beat, beat y'all A lets rock y'all, ya don't stop It go: Hotel, motel, whatcha gonna do today (say what) Cause I'mma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ Everybody go: Hotel, motel, holiday inn You see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends A like that y'all to the beat y'all A beat, beat y'all ya don't stop Uh, Master Gee am I mellow? Its on you so whatcha gonna do?  [Verse 10: Master Gee] Well like Johnny Carson on the late show A like Frankie Crocker in stereo Well like the barkay's singing holy ghost The sounds to throw down they're played the most Just like my man Captain Sky Whose name he earned with his super sperm We rock and we don't stop Get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got To the beat that it makes you freak And come alive girl, uh, get on your feet A like a Perry Mason without a case Like Farrah Fawcett without her face Like the barkays on the mic Like getting right down for you tonight Like moving your body so ya don't know how Right to the rhythm and throw down Like coming alive to the Master Gee The brother who rocks so viciously I said the age of one my life begun At the age of two I was doing the do At the age of three it was you and me Rocking to the sounds of the Master Gee At the age of four I was on the floor Giving all the freaks what they bargained for At the age of five I didn't take no jive With the Master Gee its all the way live At the age of six I was uh, picking up sticks Rapping to the beat my stick was fixed At the age of seven I was rocking in heaven dontcha know I went off I got right on down to the beat you see Getting right on down making all the girls Just take of their clothes to the beat the beat To the double beat, beat that makes you freak At the age of eight I was, uh,  really great Cause every night you see I had a date At the age of nine I was, uh, right on time Cause every night I had a part to rhyme Going on and on and on, on and on The beat don't stop until the break of dawn A saying on and on and on, on and on Like a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn A saying on and on and on on and on Cause I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic I am the definite feast delight I'm a helluva man when I'm on the mic I am the definite feast delight Call me the master gee you see The brother who rocks so viciously  [Fadeout] I'm gonna freak ya here I'm gonna freak ya there I'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere... .....The east to the west, I rock you the best....
