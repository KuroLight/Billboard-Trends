This line is bad, I'm fading Ship to shore Answer my call Send me a signal A beacon to bring me home  I have been to see the world Tasted life at every turn But all the time your face Came back to haunt me Day by day the feeling grew I know I'm still in love with you The further I go the more I know it I wanna show it  Ship to shore Do you read me anymore? This line is bad, I'm fading Ship to shore Answer my call Send me a signal A beacon to bring me home  Moving fast all systems go You and I had time to grow Until there was a breakdown in transmission How I wish that we could turn the clock back To the times when we were lovers In the true sense of the meaning You must believe me  Ship to shore Do you read me anymore? This line is bad, I'm drowning Ship to shore Answer my call Send me a signal A beacon to bring me home  Ship to shore Ship to shore  I cannot believe my eyes But I'm beginning to see it now  Ship to shore Ship to shore  You are everything I've always wanted in my life  ",

Can't pretend you surprise me And baby it's hurting me too  Hang on girl, meet my heart It knows the best time for new love to start Hang on now, meet my heart It knows the best time for us to start Hang on girl (hang on girl) Won't you remain?  Those special moments together I don't understand But can't we go ahead as we had planned? I've questioned all your reasons Underneath I can see Somewhere my stolen lover Who really should still be with me  Hang on girl, meet my heart It knows the best time for new love to start Hang on now, meet my heart It knows the best time for us to start Hang on girl, meet my heart It knows the best time for new love to start  Should I hang on - should I stay? What's the ransom - I will pay?  Hang on girl, meet my heart It knows the best time for new love to start Hang on now, meet my heart It knows the best time for us to start  (REPEAT CHORUS TO FADE)  ",
