Yeah, I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  [Verse 2] Next chapter How'd we end up this way? See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy And you're doing your best to avoid me I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here But you held your pride like you should have held me  [Pre-Chorus] Oh, I'm scared to see the ending Why are we pretending this is nothing? I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud  [Chorus] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah, and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now  [Bridge] This is looking like a contest Of who can act like they care less But I liked it better when you were on my side The battle's in your hands now But I would lay my armor down If you say you'd rather love than fight So many things that you wish I knew But the story of us might be ending soon  [Chorus] Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah, and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now And we're not speaking And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, because we're going down And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now The End  ",
