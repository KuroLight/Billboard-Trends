[Verse 1] His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already\u2014Mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, time's up, over\u2014blaow! Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it He knows, his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Verse 2] His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking, make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring, but superstardom's Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads, God only Knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner But the beat goes on\u2014da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Verse 3] No more games, I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed I've been chewed up, and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to- five, and I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me To wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me To the point I'm like a snail, I've got To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option\u2014failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better\u2026  [Outro] You can do anything you set your mind to, man  ",

Where do niggas go when we die? Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga That's why we go to thug mansion That's the only place where thugs get in free And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion  [Verse 1: 2Pac] A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you Picture me inside the misery of poverty No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on We found a finally spot to kick it Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's We still visualize places that we can roll in peace And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion  [Hook: Anthony Hamilton] Ain't no place I'd rather be Chillin' with homies and family Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky Ain't no place I'd rather be Only place that's right for me Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Will I survive all the fights and the darkness? Trouble sparks, they tell me: \"Home is where the heart is.\" Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears And couldn't sleep good for multiple years Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains Please explain why they can't stand us Is there a way for me to change? Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain? I need a place to rest my head With the little bit of homeboys that remains \u2018Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to roll?

Black Sheep of the family But we one in the same, that's why we get along Freak off and get it on When we make love looking something like soft porn Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??
