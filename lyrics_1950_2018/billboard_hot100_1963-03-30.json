Hey baby! I saw your wife the other day! Yeah? Yeah, an' she's ugly! Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby! Yeah, alright!  If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life Never make a pretty woman your wife So for my personal point of view Get an ugly girl to marry you  If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life Never make a pretty woman your wife So for my personal point of view Get an ugly girl to marry you  If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life Never make a pretty woman your wife So for my personal point of view Get an ugly girl to marry you  If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life Never make a pretty woman your wife So for my personal point of view Get an ugly girl to marry you  ",

With all the other girls you've played; well That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are mad  (That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made)  I know you're not sincere, and you'll never be But, still, I want your kisses so desperately I can never let you go Baby, even though I know every rule of love you've disobeyed; well  That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made That's how heartaches are made  ",

Yes, who's to know the girl I loved Laughed when she turned me down?  So, tell a joke, funny man Be gay, funny man Don't give yourself away, funny man Pretend you didn't love her anyway  Act as though nothin's wrong Wear good smile to go alone Then cry, cry the whole night through 'Cause there's nothin' you can do  ",
