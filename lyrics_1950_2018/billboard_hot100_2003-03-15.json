I'm feeling a little low\" She said \"I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go\" So they went down and they sat on the pier He said \"I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care I got no one, to send a letter to Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?\"  [Chorus] I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy Too young, for him they told her Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waiting for the soldier to come back again Never more to be alone When the letter says a soldier's coming home  [Verse 2] So the letters came from an army camp In California then Vietnam And he told her of his heart, it might be love And all of the things he was so scared of Said \"when it's getting kinda rough over here I think of that day sitting down on the pier And I close my eyes, and see your pretty smile Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while\"  [Chorus] I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy Too young, for him they told her Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waiting for the soldier to come back again Never more to be alone When the letter says a soldier's coming home  [Verse 3] One Friday night at a football game The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang A man said 'folks, would you bow your heads For a list of local Vietnam dead\" Crying all alone under the stands was a piccolo player in the marching band And one name read, and nobody really cared But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair  [Chorus] I cried Never gonna hold the hand of another guy Too young, for him they told her Waiting for the love of a travelin' soldier Our love will never end Waiting for the soldier to come back again Never more to be alone When the letter says a soldier's coming home  ",
