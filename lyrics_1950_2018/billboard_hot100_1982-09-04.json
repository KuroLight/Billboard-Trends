And that's close enough to perfect for me Now, She's been known to wear her pants too tight And drinking puts her out just like a light Heaven knows she's not an angel But she'd really like to be And that's close enough to perfect for me  [Chorus] She kisses me each morning And smiles a sleepy smile! She don't have to say it I can see it in her eyes!  [Verse 2] Don't you worry about my woman And what you think she aught to be! She's close enough to perfect for me! Sometimes she gets down and starts to cry! But then again a lady has a right She's everything I ever wanted! She's all I'll ever need! She's close enough to perfect for me!  [Chorus]  [Outro] Don't you worry about my woman And what you think she aught to be! She's close enough to perfect,for me![x2]  ",

My attorney will be in touch\" Mhmm  So I decided right then and there I was gonna do what's right Give 'er her fair share But brother I didn't know her share was gonna be that much  [Chorus 1] She got the goldmine (She got the goldmine) I got the shaft (I got the shaft) They split it right down the middle And then they give her the better half Well it all sounds sorta funny But it hurts too much to laugh She got the goldmine, I got the shaft  [Verse 2] Now listen, you ain't heard nothin' yet Why they give her the color televison set Then they give her the house The kids And both of the cars  See? Well then they started talkin' about child support Alimony And the costs to the court Didn't take me long to figure out how far in the toilet I was  I'm tellin' ya they have made a mistake Cause it adds up to more than this cowboy makes Besides, everything I ever had worth takin' they've already took  While she's livin' like a queen On alimony I'm workin' two shifts Eatin' baloney Askin' myself, \"Why didn't you just learn how to cook?\"  [Chorus 2] They give her the goldmine, (She got the goldmine) They give me the shaft (I got the shaft) They said they're splittin' it all down the middle But she got the better half Well, it all sounds mighty funny But it hurts too much to laugh She got the goldmine, I got the shaft  [Chorus 3] Well, she got the goldmine, (She got the goldmine) I got the shaft (I got the shaft) They split it all down the middle And then they give her the better half Well, I guess it all sounds funny (Ahh, ha ha ha) But it hurts too much to laugh She got the goldmine, I got the shaft  [Outro] Heh, heh. Hey ain't kidding. I got the shaft But I don't have to worry about totin' a billfold anymore Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha I let my wife tote it, I'm gonna be carryin' food stamps You get it judge? I'm gonna be indebted That's not funny, huh? Huh? Contempt of court? What do you mean I'm- Listen judge, I'm just kiddin' I mean You can't get blood out of a turnip, can ya? (Ha ha ha)  ",
