Shut up it was a hit and he became a star He got him some tight britches, got him a manager Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back And took up playin' the guitar And every Sunday afternoon You can go see Harry at the zoo And the girls will scream and he'll sit on his swing And pick and sing his hit record for you  Hoo hoo hoo Hoo hoo hoo Hoo hoo hoo ...

I'm afraid to go home Back to Tennessee, afraid of what I'll see  As I walk down this dusty road, got a heart with a heavy load Ain't one thing that's the same, so much sorrow and pain Headin' home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile Ain't heard nobody sing, ain't seen one livin' thing  Someone's waitin' for me, honey sweet as candy Wanna hold her tightLord, make her be all right Maybe 'round on next bend, all the ashes of land Valleys will be green instead of what I've seen  I'm afraid for the scrubby pine, for the sweet honeysuckle vine I'm afraid for my home, for the fields that I roamed Kick along down a homeward road, and your heart's gotta take the load I'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home  Sherman's been in my town, burned it all to the ground Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea Now there's not a tree 'tween Memphis and the Sea  ",

When the world outside my arms is pulling us apart Press your lips to mine and hold me with your heart!  For true love never runs smooth \u2013 That's what they say, but True love is worth all the pain \u2013 The heartaches and tears we have to face!  Oh, For true love never runs smooth That's what they say, but True love is worth all the pain \u2013 The heartaches and tears we have to face!  ",
