Sitting in a bar in a seaside town Sweet little love getting high getting down Sailors see her running along the beach Laugh and jump out of reach  Wild music blowing in her mane She needs a bareback rider won't give her no pain A hard racy game of give and take Leaves them dazed- half crazed - in her wake  'Kick it out - kick it out!' she said 'Kick out your motor and drive While you're still alive - kick it out!'
