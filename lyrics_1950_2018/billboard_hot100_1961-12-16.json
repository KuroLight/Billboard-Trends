If we stop to gaze upon a star People talk about how bad we are... Ours is not an easy age We're like tigers in a cage What a Town Without Pity can do..  The young have problems Many problems We need an understanding heart.. Why don't they help us, try to help us Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...  Take these eager lips and hold me fast.. I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two.. What a town Without Pity can do..  How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two.. What a town Without Pity can do..  ",

ASCAP (Small sad Sam, small sad Sam) Here's a tale of a man who was puny and weak Stood four foot six in his stocking feet Kinda narrow in the shoulder and heavy in the waist Everything about him seemed to be misplaced, small Sam (Small sad Sam) He slid into town one rainy night Runnin' like a dog away from a fight He had a pretty big mouth for a guy his size And everything he said was a pack of lies, small Sam (Small sad Sam) One day he got on a downtown bus First thing you know there was an awful fuss They threw Sam off into the street For trying to steal an old lady's seat, bad Sam (Small bad Sam) One day nobody know's what for An elevator stuck on the eighty-fifth floor Some cables broke and so it's said That car just hung there by a thread The women were calm and the men were balm But Sam screamed and cried like a little child He squeezed himself through the emergency door And pulled himself up to the eighty-sixth floor Small Sam, chicken Sam (Small chicken Sam) And then instead of helpin' others get free Sam said, \"I'm lookin' out for me\" The cable snapped and all the way down They cursed out Sam when they hit the ground, small Sam (Small sad Sam) Now someday Sam's gonna get his due And when he does I'll make a bet with you There ain't nobody even gonna pass a hat Cause Sam was nothin' but a no good cat (Small sad Sam) Yes, small Sam (Small sad Sam) Chicken Sam (Small sad Sam) No good Sam (Small sad Sam) FADE: (Small sad Sam) Above, and are for personal use and research interest only  ",
