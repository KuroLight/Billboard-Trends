She comes on like she's so high-classed and well-bred But I never saw a girl with such a swelled head She's got herself a mighty long wait If she thinks I'll ask her for a date But, where does she live, what's her number and How can I meet her?  Spoken: She's in love with herself; you know the kind Always puttin' on airs!  The guys in town all think she's a Mona Lisa And she's got 'em all goin' out of their way to please her Whatever they see's a mystery \u2018Cause she don't do a thing to me But where 's she live, what's her number and How can I meet her?
