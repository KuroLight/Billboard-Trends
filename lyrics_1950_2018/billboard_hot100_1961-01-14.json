Does your memory stray To a bright sunny day When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?  [Verse 2] Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare? Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there? Is your heart filled with pain Shall I come back again? Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?  Spoken: I wonder if you're lonesome tonight You know someone said that the world's a stage And each of us must play a part Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart Act one was where we met I loved you at first glance You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange And why I've never know Honey, you lied when you said you loved me And I had no cause to doubt you But I'd rather go on hearing your lies Than to go on living without you Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there With emptiness all around And if you won't come back to me Then they can bring the curtain down  [Outro] Is your heart filled with pain Shall I come back again? Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?  ",
