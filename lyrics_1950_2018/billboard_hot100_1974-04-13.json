Dark lady played black magic 'Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  [Verse 2] She dealt two cards, a queen and a three And mumbled some words that were so strange to me And then she turned up a two-eyed jack My eyes saw red but the card still stayed black She said, \"The man you love is secretly true To someone else who is very close to you! My advice is that you leave this place Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!\"  [Chorus] Dark lady laughed and danced And lit the candles one by one; Danced to her gypsy music Till her brew was done... Dark lady played black magic Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  [Verse 3] So I ran home and crawled in my bed I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said Then I remembered her strange perfume And how I smelled it once in my own room So I snuck back and caught her with my man; Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand... The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor-- Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

        "lyrics": "  My little boy came into the kitchen this evening While I was fixing supper And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on And after wiping my hands on my apron I read it - and this is what it said  For mowing the yard - five dollars And for making my own bed this week - one dollar And for going to the store - fifty cents An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping Twenty-five cents Taking out the trash - one dollar Getting a good report card - five dollars And for raking the yard - two dollars Total owed - fourteen seventy-five  Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly And a thousand memories flashed through my mind So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over This is what I wrote:  For nine months I carried you Growing inside me - no charge For the nights I've sat up with you Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge For the time and the tears And the cost through the years, there's no charge When you add it all up The full cost of my love is no charge  For the nights filled with dread And the worries ahead - no charge For advice and the knowledge And the cost of your college - no charge For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose There's NO CHARGE, son When you add it all up The full cost of my love, is - charge  Well, when he finished readin' He had great big old tears in his eyes And he looked up at me and he said \"Mama, I sure do love you.\" Then he took the pen And in great big letters He wrote: \"Paid in full.\"  When you add it all up The cost of real love is - no charge  ",

Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain Think of it as being a great big rock Won't you think before you started to roll it down Because once you start it, you can't make it stop  I've given all I have to give And if you don't want me I don't want to leave  Well and Why\u2026 Must the same love that made me laugh\u2026 Why you wanna make me cry?  Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry?  Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow Just cryin' like a weeping willow  Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry?  Why you wanna make me mess in my pillow I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow  Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry? Why you wanna make me cry?  ",
