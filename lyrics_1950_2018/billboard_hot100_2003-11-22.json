Remember how I made you scream? I don't understand what happened to our love But baby when I get you back I'm gonna show you what I'm made of  [Chorus] I can see you Your brown skin shinin' in the sun I see you walkin' real slow and you're smilin' at everyone I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone  [Verse 3] Out on the road today I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac A little voice inside my head said \"Don't look back. You can never look back.\" I thought I knew what love was What did I know? Those days are gone forever I should just let them go but  [Chorus] I can see you Your brown skin shinin' in the sun You got that top pulled down and that radio on, baby And I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone I can see you Your brown skin shinin' in the sun You got that hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby I can tell you my love for you will still be strong After the boys of summer have gone  ",
