Gravity may bring you down (down) (down) But harmony could spin you 'round (around) Information Ariel says buy, buy, buy material Give take all day long Can't you see it's Hopeless being strong When you've got live it wrong?

Buy, buy, buy Buy, buy, buy  So give me your attention I know it's getting late While we were dreaming Something slipped away We're drowning in possessions Playing tricks with our minds Lost from one another Baby, put your hand in mine Time is slipping away But it's not too late  How much is enough when your soul is empty?

Cash money ain't never gonna play out I got nothin to lose, much to gain In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car Go to school, I ain't goin for it Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet Cause I don't wanna hear that crap Why? I'd rather be a New Jack... Hustler  [Chorus] Hustler Hustler Hustler H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler  [Kid drop in] Yo man you know what I'm sayin? You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels Look at that ring right there I know it's real, it's gotta be real Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life! Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man How can I be down?  What's up? You say you wanna be down? Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down Out my face, fool I'm the illest Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags All I think about is keys and Gs Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha) That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you! I'm rollin with the New Jack crew And I'm a hustler  H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler New Jack, New Jack..........  Here I come, so you better break North As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth I care nothing bout you, and that's evident All I love's my dope and dead presidents Sound crazy? Well it isn't The ends justifies the means, that's the system I learned that in school then I dropped out Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout I had nothing, and I wanted it You had everything, and you flaunted it Turned the needy into the greedy With cocaine, my success came speedy Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox Every dollar I get, another brother drops Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned I gotta get paid, I got money to earn With my posse, out on the ave Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream? So think twice if you're coming down my block You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot Pregnant teens, children's screams Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam You don't come here much, and ya better not Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot I gotta get more money than you got So what, if some muthafucka gets shot? That's how the game is played Another brother slayed, the wound is deep But they're givin us a band aid My education's low but I got long dough I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro Sleep on silk, lie like a politician My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe There'll be another one after me! A hustler Hustler H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler  New Jack, New Jack......  ",

But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman [?] superior to handle any male Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show And if you ask my producers, they'll reply \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  [Hook: Ice Cube] \u201cYou can't play with my Yo-Yo!\u201d (Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)  [Verse 1] My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt To the fact I hit the 8-ball often The earrings I wear are called Dolphins Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother) I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?

Yeah, tell em whats up  [Verse 3: Yo-Yo] Yo, I hope you realize one day That you're \"weak\" as Monday through Sunday So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio And next to me? Ha! You're not fly, yo?! You lack skills to be a woman that's black Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?! Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya Because the world ain't a big soap opera It only takes one punch to drop ya And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya But no, I'm not living like that verse Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right) But no, it's not to cause corruptions Just to fight back on destruction Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

For all y'all suckas Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it You can't play wit my Yo-Yo  [Verse 4] I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, \"More, more!\" I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior Should we dare to take the stand And diss back all the men Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?

Let's not give up hope We have to find a way Search within our soul To make a better day  [Chorus:] This house is our house Let's do it for the people It's all in the hands of love  This house is their house Let's give it back to the people The people of the world today  [Verse 2:] I see hurt in their eyes I hear the sounds of voices cry It's time to open our eyes Time to help one another  [Repeat Hook:]  [Repeat Chorus:]  [Bridge:] You, me We can make the difference And you know No one No one likes to be alone, yeah  We got to face it heart to heart We have to make a brand new start We got to change the tears to smiles We have to go the extra mile  It's time we face reality To give them hope and set them free I think it's time we say goodbye To all the homeless people's cry  We got to face it heart to heart We have to make a brand new start We got to change the tears to smiles We have to go the exta mile  (You, me) It's time we face reality (We can make the difference) Give them hope and set them free I think it's time we say goodbye To all the homeless people's cry (And you know)  [Rap:] We've got to take the time To search the mind to find  This house, our house (It's all in the hands of love) (I said it's all in the hands of love)  [Repeat Chorus:]  Let's do it Let's do it for the people  This house Let's give back to the people The people of the world today  Do it for the people  This house Give back to the people, yeah  It's all in the hands of love  ",

        "lyrics": "  [Verse One] Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene With a lean and a pocket full of green The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top But Robocop last year was a shock The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt Kids are screaming; the media says, \"What... Kind of music is this for you to dance to?\" The man with the plan and the man demands you Leave the smack and the crack for the wack Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that Leave the knife and the gun in the store And ignore temptation, sent by the nation Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef Hawkins, and when you're walking, you don't just run Black on black; remember that; it's important Anyway the struggle is won, brings forth the fun No hatred; the summer's almost done No time for sleep, jump in your Jeep And pump up the funky beat a whole week Beeper goes off, yo, smash it and trash it You're too young to be plumped in a casket Just get your boys and bring the noise And just swing it, and party people, sing it  [Chorus] Treat me right, I'll treat you good  [Verse Two] Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man \"Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam? I'm his number one fan, yes I am\" All these kids realize that I'm the man Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger Than last year, but still a unique figure Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on Next to me at all times, ready to kick a rhyme That will keep me out of financial bind That's why when it comes to fans, I'm never mean Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene Always says hello, cause I'm a modest fellow Never try to play a superstar, that's hollow Cause if these kids don't go buy our records We'll be has-beens, and plus naked So we owe them, so pull out your pen Sign an autograph, you might make a new friend So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it And party people in the house, sing it  [Chorus]  [Verse Three] Party people in the house, listen up I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!) Sanity Crystal, my niece And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace And leave the guns and have fun; out! And oh yeah, sing it  [Chorus]  [Instrumental Break]  [Verse Four] Well, coming back To nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene With a lean and a hardcore dream The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic Decency started from the crib, plus kids Don't need to hear all of that on the rap The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map Cause authority, seniority goes far My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs Read my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right Just treat me right, peace!  [Outro] Treat me right Treat me right Treat me right  ",

The Sherriff, he belongs in a prison cell Keep your mouth shut, that's what we're going to do Unless you want to wind up in the wishing well too  I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin I know a secret that I just can't tell I know a secret down at Uncle Tom's Cabin Know who put the bodies, know who put the bodies In the wishin well Oh yea  ",
