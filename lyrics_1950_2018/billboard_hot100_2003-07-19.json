People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world's addicted to the drama Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate Madness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how anger works and operates Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all  [Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake] People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin' Will you practice what you preach?

If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone? So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong? With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug If you never know truth, then you never know love Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know) And where's the love y'all?

Whatever happened to the fairness and equality? Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found Now ask yourself\u2026  [Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake] Where is the love?

Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  [Verse 2] Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely \u2018cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously So I'm signin' CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, B It's all political, if my music is literal And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you!  [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Sing this shit!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away  [Verse 3] They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols And they wanna get one \u2018cause they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry, at night, wishin' they'd die 'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes That's why we seize the moment Try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it \u2018Cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can\u2026  [Hook] Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
