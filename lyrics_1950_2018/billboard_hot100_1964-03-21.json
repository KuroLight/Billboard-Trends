Oh, Nadine, honey is that you? Seems like every time I see you Darling, you got something else to do  [Verse 2] I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac I was pushin' through the crowd trying to get to where she's at And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat  [Chorus] Nadine, honey is that you? Oh, Nadine, honey where are you? Seems like every time I catch you But you're up to something new  [Verse 3] Downtown searching for her, looking all around Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading uptown I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab Flip the twenty dollar bill and told him catch that yellow cab  [Chorus] Nadine, honey is that you? Oh, Nadine, honey is that you? Seems like every time I catch you You're up to something new  [Verse 4] She moved around like a wayward summer breeze Go, driver, go, go on, catch her for me please Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear  [Chorus] Nadine, honey is that you? Oh, Nadine, honey is that you? Seems like every time I see you, darling You're up to something new  ",
