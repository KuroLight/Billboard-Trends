What do I know of life? Why can't I cast away This mask of play and live my life  Why can't I fall in love Like any other man And maybe then I'll know What kind of fool I am  ",

I'd rather think she found her love Wouldn't you rather think she did find love? Somewhere, some way Yo lo lady yay, yo lo lady yay  ",

Just because of that, they say:  \"He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should\" But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does That's no reason why I can't give him all my love He's always good to me Always treats me tenderly 'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me  If they don't like him that way They won't like me, I'm sure, today I'll be standing right by his side When they say:  \"He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should\" But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does That's no reason why we can't share love He's always good to me Good to him, I'll try to be 'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me  Oh he's not a rebel, no, no, no He's not a rebel, no, no, no  ",
