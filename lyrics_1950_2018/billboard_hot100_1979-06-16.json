And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, find a way...  While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite Then I see my old guitar in the night Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two And I'm torn between the things that I should do And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true...  And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world With my little songs, I was wrong But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me  ",
