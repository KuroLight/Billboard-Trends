I promise I'll fix it Long about a million other things  Well, it's ok. It's so nice It's just another day in paradise Well, there's no place that I'd rather be Well, it's two hearts And one dream I wouldn't trade it for anything And I ask the Lord every night For just another day in paradise  Friday, you're late Guess we'll never make our dinner date At the restaurant you start to cry Baby, we'll just improvise Well, plan B looks like Dominoes' pizza in the candle light Then we'll tippy toe to our room Make a little love that's overdue But somebody had a bad dream Mama and daddy Can me and my teddy Come in to sleep in between?  Yeah it's ok. It's so nice. It's just another day in paradise. Well, there's no place that I'd rather be Well, it's two hearts And one dream I wouldn't trade it for anything And I ask the Lord every night For just another day in paradise  Well, it's ok.

You said if I'd write you, you would write back See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on \u2018Cause I don't really got shit else So that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See, everything you say is real, and I respect you \u2018cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous \u2018cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me, man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together too  [Hook: Dido] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)] Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months, and still no word \u2014 I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\" About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin' Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together \u2014 think about it! You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you And you can't breathe without me See, Slim\u2014 shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you \u2018Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!  [Hook: Dido] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 4: Eminem] Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' Off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand That I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news A couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was\u2026 it was you, damn  ",

I was so immature I was young and having money Having honeys come to the crib Dig in their shit And they couldn't get cab money from me Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses No room service, just snacks and shit Work with those Lil Debbies And when you're done, get ready The chicks I was fiending to smash Let 'em lean on the cash Will take 'em on long trips Break 'em with long dick There was no such thing as strong relationships But I'm off that player shit I need a chick that practice Tai Chi That still can buy weed And can give me some good head And I'll make her a mami  [Hook] (Hey papi!) Even if they don't understand the flow They understand the dough, my ladies going (Hey papi!) Promise you'll never let me go Promise you'll never leave me Promise we'll grow  [Verse 2 - Memphis Bleek] The only thing Bleek spinning is Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims Home, suspended from school again I'm grown, still ill, ladies love the ve-hi-cle, like \"Bleek Can I feel up on your wood and grill?\" It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain She give me good brain Love the way I push my slang Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave Bet your man can't do it like this, like this I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this And I'm from Marcy, you catch me on anybody's block Reppin' th-the Roc Hoes, they all clock like:  [Hook]  [Verse 3 - Jay-Z] I was the worst, I used to switch chicks every day Had niggas mad, for real, like, \"I wish he was gay\" Cause they knew sooner or later hun was getting with Jay Just a matter of time: she was getting with Jay I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sipping on 'zae Spitting up in the Pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade She used to love you, but she feeling different today You used to smother her. Look at your honey slipping away Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space She said she feel free when she's around me I'm letting her do her and, in turn, she's doing me She on the phone with her friends like, \"How cool is he?\"  ",
