Now it's only me  [Hook] Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock Tick tock, tick tock (La la la la la la la...)  [Verse 1] Like a cat in heat stuck in a moving car A scary conversation, shut my eyes, can't find the brake What if they say that you're a climber? Naturally I'm worried if I do it alone Who really cares cause it's your life You never know, it could be great Take a chance cause you might grow Oh, oh oh  [Chorus] What you waiting, what you waiting What you waiting, what you waiting What you waiting for? What you waiting, what you waiting What you waiting, what you waiting What you waiting for?

Born to blossom, bloom to perish Your moment will run out Cause of your sex chromosome I know it's so messed up how our society all thinks (for sure) Life is short, you're capable (uh huh) Oh, oh oh  [Pre-Chorus] Look at your watch now You're still a super hot female You got your million dollar contract And they're all waiting for your hot track!

Still I be getting lonely for you I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay  [Verse 2: 2Pac] I call you up long distance, on the telephone Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home I whisper things in your ear like you're near me Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me? It seems to me, that you're jealous \u2018Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up! Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier And there's no way I'ma stop making money \u2018Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny Always complaining, saying we don't spend time Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind? And hanging up like you all that Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back Please, ain't nothing left to say to you Thugs get lonely too, you know  [Hook]  [Verse 3: 2Pac] I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care Talking out loud to you, like you're there Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on You're the first face I wanna see when I get home Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild Touching every wall in the house, thug style Put your hands on the headboard, think of me Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down Reminisce and relax \u2018cause, baby, right now I feel it in the middle of my stomach You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me \u2018Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true And thugs get lonely too, you know  [Hook]  [Outro: 2Pac] Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin' Aye, so you remember that Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby Thugs get lonely too We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems If you wanna be real with me, be real with me If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me  ",
