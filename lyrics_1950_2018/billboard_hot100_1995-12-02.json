Have I been lost? Inside myself and my own mind? Hypnotized Mesmerized By what my eyes have seen?

Have I been wise? To shut my eyes and play along?  Hypnotized Paralyzed By what my eyes have found By what my eyes have seen What they have seen?  [Chorus:] Have I been blind? Have I been lost?

Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  And shake me and my confidence 'Bout a great many things But I've been there, I can see it cower Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings  Of a bad play where the heroes are right And nobody thinks or expects too much And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights Singing, \"Hey babe, let's keep in touch Hey baby, let's keep in touch\"  But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me And show me all the things no one else can see So what you feel becomes mine as well And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around? Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up When all it does is slow me down?  Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking And I got some news for you It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop And there ain't a whole lot that you can do  Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder Perhaps I've grown a little cynical But I know no matter what the waitress brings I shall drink in and always be full Yeah, I will drink in and always be full  Oh, I like coffee and I like tea Like to be able to enter a final plea I still got this dream that you just can't shake I love you to the point you can no longer take Well, all right, okay, so be that way I hope and pray that there's something left to say  But you Why you wanna give me a run-around?

What did I do to you To make you be so cruel? I don't understand why you've been so wrong  I tried to be your strength You said I was too strong I tried to compromise So we could get along I gave my love to you Despite your evil ways I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say  CHORUS  BRIDGE There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart It's telling you that something is strange Ooh Girl you don't have to deny it All you got to do is just try it You'll find our love is stronger if' your willing to change  CHORUS (repeat till end)  ",

Down by law, I make law I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four Round the clock, that state pen time check it But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells Now come aboard, it's Medina bound Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin  [Hook] When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before he rocked it on Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut  ",
