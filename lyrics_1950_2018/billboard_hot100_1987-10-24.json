I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat Kiss you on the cheek and say, \"ooh girl, you're so sweet\" It's deja vu whenever I'm with you I could go on forever telling you what I do But where you at? You're neither here or there I swear I can't find you anywhere Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug This love search is really making me bug And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen? Take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean Fantasies can run, but they can't hide And when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside  [Hook] I need love I need love  [Verse 3] I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold, you just love you Suck on you neck, caress you and rub you Grind, moan and never be alone If you're not standing next to me you're on the phone Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad I've got money, but love's something I've never had I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes We're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel It's like a dream land, I can't lie, I never been there Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet I swear to you this is something I'll never forget  [Hook] I need love I need love  [Verse 4] See what I mean? I've changed, I'm no longer A playboy on the run, I need something that's stronger Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration This whole experience has been such a revelation It's taught me love and how to be a real man To always be considerate and do all I can Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much My body tingles all over from the slightest touch Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time Till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine If I find you, girl, I swear I'll be a good man I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive I'll search the whole world for that special girl When I finally find you watch our love unfurl  [Hook] I need love I need love  [Outro] Girl, listen to me. When I be sitting in my room all alone, staring at the wall Fantasies, they go through my mind, and I've come to realize that I need true love And if you wanna give it to me, girl, make yourself seen. I'll be waiting I love you  ",
