But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman [?] superior to handle any male Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show And if you ask my producers, they'll reply \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  [Hook: Ice Cube] \u201cYou can't play with my Yo-Yo!\u201d (Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)  [Verse 1] My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt To the fact I hit the 8-ball often The earrings I wear are called Dolphins Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother) I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?

Yeah, tell em whats up  [Verse 3: Yo-Yo] Yo, I hope you realize one day That you're \"weak\" as Monday through Sunday So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio And next to me? Ha! You're not fly, yo?! You lack skills to be a woman that's black Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?! Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya Because the world ain't a big soap opera It only takes one punch to drop ya And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya But no, I'm not living like that verse Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right) But no, it's not to cause corruptions Just to fight back on destruction Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

For all y'all suckas Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it You can't play wit my Yo-Yo  [Verse 4] I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, \"More, more!\" I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior Should we dare to take the stand And diss back all the men Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?

I wanna go higher (higher baby) I wanna go higher (higher baby)  So tell me baby kinda shakey We ain't been too friendly lately Things sometimes turn out that way And that is all that you got to say Well thats ok cause time can soothe Like a dentist pulls out a tooth As each new day will bring a new face How can I make my rhyme go someplace  First of all she ask for more I said sure I dont mind at all The waters deep but I'm walking tall It dont matter if you're rich or poor Ain't here to score just raise the floor Maximum vibes what I'm aiming for I do my war dance back to the wall Just returning my native call  And thats the way we're getting by ya Always keeping you on the wire Takin you higher - call me a liar But you won't cause you're feeling inspired Work we're going to , jerk you're all thru Theres no way you'll stop my breakthru Two ways to do it , get in or get out Elevate yourself don't hang about So wherever lies you'r latitude Wherever you are we're gaining altitude In all directions starting to climb So come on girl - elevate my mind  I wanna go higher (elevate my mind) I wanna go higher (higher baby) (Let it reach ya) I wanna go higher (higher baby) (Elevate my mind) I wanna go higher (higher baby)  I wanna go higher (x3)  ",

        "lyrics": "  Across the street the river runs Down in the gutter life is slipping away Let me still exist in another place Running under cover Of a helicopter blade  Flames are getting higher In effigy Burning down the bridges of my memory Love may still alive Somewhere, some way Where they're downing only deer A hundred steel towns away  Oh, the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words \"I love you\" Rolling off my tongue No, never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing  Photographs and kerosene Light up my darkness Light it up! Light it up! I can still feel the touch Of your thin blue jeans Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you, baby Oh, baby  Oh, the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words \"I love you\" Rolling off my tongue No, never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing  Oh, yeah  Oh, I've got lightning in my veins Shifting like the handle Of a slot machine Love may still exist In another place I'm just yanking back the handle No expression on my face  Oh, the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words \"I love you\" Rolling off my tongue No, never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing  Oh, the rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words \"I love you\" Rolling off my tongue No, never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing  The rhythm of my heart Is beating like a drum With the words \"I love you\" rolling off my tongue No, never will I roam For I know my place is home Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing  ",
