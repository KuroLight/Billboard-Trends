Now, you must lie in that county jail Where I can't get to you by visit or mail So squirm - with discomfort - wiggle and cough Six days of madness, hah, and you might throw me off Curse me in name, defy me in speech But you'd pick me up right now if I were in your reach All through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate Hear now, young man and woman, I'll be waiting at the gate Don't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased Sure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste Behold, you're hooked Your foot is in the stirrup And make -- haste Mount the steed and ride him well For the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell To Hell Will ride you to Hell Until you are dead Dead, brother, Dead This is a revolution of the mind Get your mind together And get away from drugs That's the man Back, back  ",

I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots.\"  Took a corner; sideswiped a truck Crossed my fingers just for luck My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts The guy beside me was white as a ghost  Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?  We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension. Man! What a ride! I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!\"  ",

        "lyrics": "  [Verse 1: Peter Yarrow] Three horses grazing out my window Brown, black, and white they stand Rolling pastures they can wander Free and easy is their land  [Chorus] Don't ever take away my freedom Don't ever take it away Let me treasure and keep that one part of my life And the rest we're gonna find one of these days  [Verse 2] Is that the sound of a raindrops I hear falling? How I love, love to hear that sound It makes me think of all the people that I love And all the quiet moments I've found  [Chorus: Yarrow, Stokey, and ?] Don't ever take away my freedom Don't ever take it away We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives And the rest we're gonna find one of these days... One of these days  [Verse 3: Yarrow and Stokey] When I am old and thinking over the whole life that I've led If there's one final wish left to me I will pray that the children, who are yet to be born I will pray that they will always live free  [Chorus: Yarrow, Stokey, and ?] Don't ever take away their freedom Don't ever take it away We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives And the rest we're gonna find one of these days One of these days  [Verse 4: Yarrow and ?] There is a time for the singing and the sunshine There is a time for the thunder and the rain There is a time for the changing of seasons my friend But there is one thing we must never change  [Chorus: Yarrow, McCarthy, and Stokey] Don't ever take away our freedom Don't ever take it away We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives And the rest we're gonna find one of these days  Don't ever take away our freedom Don't ever take it away We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives And the rest we're gonna find one of these days  Don't ever take away our freedom Don't ever take it away We must cherish and keep that one part of our lives And the rest we're gonna find one of these days (fade out)  ",
