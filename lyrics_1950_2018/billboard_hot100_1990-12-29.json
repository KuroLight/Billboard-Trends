No she does not Really see me Cause she sees Her own reflection  And I'm trying Not to notice That she's hitching Up her skirt  And while she's Straightening her stockings Her hair Has gotten wet  Oh, this rain It will continue Through the morning As I'm listening  To the bells Of the cathedral I am thinking Of your voice...  And of the midnight picnic Once upon a time Before the rain began...  I finish up my coffee It's time to catch the train Tatatatatararatatatatarara  ",

        "lyrics": "  Endlessly walking through a winter thats so bitterly cold Christmas is coming all the stores are wrapped in their neon glow But I don't feel festive Oh I've lost the woman I held so dear I'm so reflective as I think of all our happy years I brush against a stranger So I turn to apologize And I saw her, with another man, and a sparkle in her eyes  Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will to survive  I walked to a cafe where I sat and stared at an empty wall The waitress talked to me, but I could not hear her words at all The only sound that I could hear was the screaming of my soul My world revolved around one single thing I wish to know  Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will to survive  The weather was changing, snow began falling The sky became dark like the mood of my heart I watched all the lovers Sharing together, their smiles and laughter were painful reminders I seem to recapture the moment I held her I made her swear that she'd always be there But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow As soon as I wake there's a pain I can't shake in my heart  Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will Does she love him? Does she love him? Does she love that man?  ",

In the ghetto, you keep one eye open All day long, just hoping and hoping You can pay your bills and not drink too much Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up Like me, but you don't see Ten years from now, where will you be?

All you gotta do is just be yourself We're all the same color underneath Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me Never be ashamed of what you are Proud to be black, stand tall and hard Even though some people give you no respect Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check 'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say So if you don't listen, it's not my fault I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth While me and my people try to get out  [Chorus] The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Funky, funky ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to survive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to stay alive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Funky, funky ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Got no place else to go) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to stay alive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)  ",

And in remembering a road sign I am remembering a girl when I was young And we said these songs are true These days are ours These tears are free And hey The cross is in the ballpark The cross is in the ballpark  [Chorus - Paul Simon] We had a lot of fun We had a lot of money We had a little son and we thought we'd call him \"Sonny\" Sonny gets married and moves away Sonny has a baby and bills to pay Sonny gets sunnier Day by day by day by day  [Verse 2 - Paul Simon] I've been waking up at sunrise I've been following the light across my room I watch the night receive the room of my day Some people say the sky is just the sky But I say: Why deny the obvious child? Why deny the obvious child?  [Bridge - Paul Simon] Sonny sits by his window and thinks to himself How it's strange that some rooms are like cages Sonny's yearbook from high school Is down from the shelf And he idly thumbs through the pages Some have died Some have fled from themselves Or struggled from here to get there Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls Runs his hand through his thinning brown hair  [Outro - Paul Simon] Well I'm accustomed to a smoother ride Maybe I'm a dog that's lost his bite I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more I don't expect to sleep the night Some people say a lie is just a lie But I say the cross is in the ballpark Why deny the obvious child?
