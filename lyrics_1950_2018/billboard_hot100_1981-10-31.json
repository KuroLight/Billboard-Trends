[Chorus] Young hearts be free tonight Time is on your side Don't let them put you down Don't let 'em push you around Don't let 'em ever change your point of view  [Pre-instrumental] Come on babe!  [Instrumental Break]  [Bridge] Young hearts, be free tonight Time is on, on your side  [Verse 3] Billy wrote a letter back home To Patti's parents tryin' to explain He said: 'We're both real sorry That it had to turn out this way'  But there ain't no point in talking When there's nobody listening So we just ran away Patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!  [Chorus] Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side Young hearts be free tonight, time is on your side Young hearts be free tonight, time in on your side  Young hearts gotta run free Be free, live free Time is on, time is on your side Time, time, time Time is on your side Is on your side Is on your side Is on your side Young heart be free tonight Tonight, tonight, tonight Tonight, tonight, yeah  ",

I need a second chance  Save me from all the trouble and the pain I know I'm weak, but I can't face that girl again Tell her the reasons why I can't remain Perhaps she'll understand if you tell it to her plain  And if she asks you why, you can tell her that I told you That I'm tired of castles in the air I've got a dream I want the world to share And castle walls just lead me to despair  ",
