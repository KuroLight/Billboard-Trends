You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?  Oh, no, not I, I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive I've got my life to live, and I've got all my love to give And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive  It took all my strength not to fall apart Trying with all my mind to mend  my broken heart I spent,  so many nights feeling sorry for myself Oh, I used to cry but now I hold my head up high  And you see me, somebody new Not that lonely little person still in love with you Now you come dropping in  expecting me to be free Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me  Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now You're not welcome anymore You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?  Oh, no, not I, I will survive Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive I've got  my life to live, and all my love to give And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now You're not welcome anymore You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

Blue morning, can't you see what your love has done to me?  [Verse 2] I've always listened to your point of view, my ways are cut through men And I've always been a patient man, but my patience has reached its end You tell me you're leaving, you tell me goodbye You say you might send a letter Well honey don't telephone, cause I won't be alone I need someone to make me feel better  [Chorus] [x2]  [Outro] Blue morning, blue morning [x3] Blue, blue, blue day  ",
