Make it somehow all seem worthwhile How on earth did I get so jaded? Life's mystery seems so faded  I can go where no one else can go I know what no one else knows Here I am, just drowning in the rain With a ticket for a runaway train  And everything seems cut and dry Day and night Earth and sky Somehow I just don't believe it  Runaway train never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Bought a ticket for a runaway train Like a madman laughing at the rain A little out of touch, a little insane It's just easier than dealing with the pain  Runaway train never going back Wrong way on a one-way track Seems like I should be getting somewhere Somehow I'm neither here nor there  Runaway train never coming back Runaway train tearing up the track Runaway train burning in my veins Runaway but it always seems the same  ",

(It's my life) It's my life my problems! (It's my life) It's my life my worries! (It's my life) It's my life my problems! (It's my life)  [Verse 2] Do you understand I live the way I want to live I make decisions day and night Show me signs and good examples Stop telling me how to run your business Take a trip to east and west You find that you don't know anything Every's getting tired of you Sometimes you have to look and listen You can even learn from me Little knowledge is dangerous It's my life  [Hook] (It's my life) It's my life my worries! (It's my life) It's my life my problems! (It's my life) It's my life my worries! (It's my life) It's my life my problems!

Change what I put, slavery you need to be free  Chorus:  So maybe you need to swing my way Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way I'm the one you should chose Girl you won't be abused So maybe you need to swing my way Maybe you need to swing my way Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way Not like the man you're with now, I keep my hands to myself So maybe you need to swing my way  Verse Two:  Mistreated you like a towel And when he gets busted he thinks that he's an owl Your eye is puffy, your jaw is swollen You shouldn't be smacked, you're made to cuddle and hold an Cores and snuggle like a Teddy Bear His attitude's changed, begins to put fear In your heart, but you depart from being afraid Many thoughts of leaving were crushed so you stayed Saying what he did before he won't do again He wants more of a lover and less of a friend Catch my drift? You're put to the test so You refuse and get struck with a left blow He tells you in a flame way \"That's what you get for rejecting your man\" Hey Now you're crying on the floor Your man's no damn good, need I say more?  Chorus  Verse Three:  Now I'm not saying I'm an angel, I got many associates I treat them all right and appropriate I'm not talking marriage and settling down But I can treat you much better than that clown No matter what I say you still seem to protect him No matter the amount of times you're hit you respect him Damn, if you only knew How much affection could be given to you If you move the right way which is my way Forget what your so-called-boyfriend might say You're too good for his kind Widen your horizons and focus your mind On a real man. I won't stress you or keep sweating it I'll buy your clothes but pay your rent it's kind of pressin it So tell me, who do you chose? Here's an alter way then either win or can lose  Chorus (x4)  Maybe you need to swing my way  ",
