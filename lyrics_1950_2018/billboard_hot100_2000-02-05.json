Because from the moment that I saw your face And felt the fire in your sweet embrace I swear I knew I'm going to love you forever  [Verse 2] My mind fails to understand What my heart tells me to do And I'd give up all I have just to be with you And that would do I've always been taught to win And I never thought I'd fall Be at the mercy of a man I've never been Now I only want to be right where you are  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] In my life I've learned that heaven never waits no Lets take this now before it's gone like yesterday Because when I'm with you there's nowhere else That I would ever want to be no I'm breathing for the next second I can feel you Loving me I'm going to love  [Chorus]  ",

As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there I respect your mom's tutelage But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this? Watch and learn, foolish kid Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am Look, same pedigree, theoretically Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically One job in life to make you a much better me Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it My hands were in bondage, useless Beyond the excuses, calm through it It\u2019s crazy, our bond music And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit So right now I stand in a place I never stood before Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for Now it's better than we pictured it'd be And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it Little nigga we'll be  [Interlude] This is greater than us.

Ho please! You better bow down on both knees Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the oldies Eazy E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's, the Snoop D-O-double-G's And the group that said \"Mothafuck the police!\" Gave you a tape full of dope beats To bump when you stroll through in your hood And when your album sales wasn't doing too good Who's the Doctor they told you to go see? Y'all better listen up closely All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep So fuck y'all, all of y'all! If y'all don't like me, blow me! Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me And turn me back to the old me  [Hook: Eminem] Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  [Verse 2: Eminem] So what do you say to somebody you hate Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way? Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? Just study a tape of N.W.A One day I was walking by With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy Give me an awkward eye And I strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge When I'm drunk as fuck Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage Hoppin' out with two broken legs, trying to walk it off Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops! I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barking dogs And when the cops came through Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches And still weren't found out (Right here!) So from here on out, it's the Chronic II Starting today and tomorrow's anew And I'm still loco enough To choke you to death with a Charleston Chew Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up When the temp goes up to the mid-80s Callin' men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy There's no way that you can save me It's okay, go with him, Hailie!

Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns Like I ain't got none; what, you think I sold 'em all \u2018Cause I stay well off? Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off What, \u2018cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad Tryin' to get this damn label off? I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath It ain't gonna be nothin' after that So give me one more platinum plaque And fuck rap, you can have it back So where's all the Mad Rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch  [Hook: Eminem] Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  ",

Playin' wit' minds that get you state time Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind Killa bees in the club wit' this ladybug Brought a sword to the dance floor to cut a rug Love is love all day, til' they throw slugs And take another life in cold blood, can't feel me 'til its your blood Murder rates tremendous, crime is endless Same shit different day, Father forgive us They know not what they do, all praise is due I'm big like Easy and Big Bambu  [Hook: Method Man & Fred Durst] What's that? I didn't hear you Shut the fuck up! Come on, a little louder! Shut the fuck up! Everybody in together now Shut the fuck up! What, huh? Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up! What's that? I didn't hear you Shut the fuck up! Come on, a little louder! Shut the fuck up! Everybody in together now Shut the fuck up! What, huh? Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!  [Verse 3: Method Man & Method Man + Fred] Headstrong, dead calm, Dead by Dawn Dead weight, they dead wrong, let's get it on Twelve rounds of throw down \u2013 who hold crown? Protect land wit' four pound, Limp Bizkit Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario Comin' through your stereo, why risk it? Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted Eight essential vitamins and minerals, delicious Word on the street is, they bit my thesis Knocked out they front teefes, tryin' to taste mine Actin' like they heard it through the grapevine Dope fiendin' for the bassline, to provide rhyme Pharmaceuticals, hard as nails to the cuticles Where'd you find that monster? She beautiful Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit, roll on the set Kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, and then jet  [Verse 4: Fred Durst & Method Man] Mic check, so what's it all about? And where we gonna run? Maybe we can meet up on the sun Discretion is advised for the blood of virgin eyes We limpin' on the track with the Method So get the sunblock, you gettin' one-shot Until you dissolve, I revolve around everything you got From outta nowhere, prepare, you be blinded by the glare I told you not to stare, now you're turned into stone Without a microphone, but don't you forget you're in a zone So shut the fuck up, and take that shit back 'Cause all your shit's wack (Doo doo is doo doo) When its weighed out like that Burnin' up your brain like a piston So all those that didn't listen, now they even knew what they were missin' And never even knew that the sky was fallin' down Wu-Tang-Clan for the crown  [Hook: Method Man] What's that? I didn't hear you Shut the fuck up! Come on, a little louder! Shut the fuck up! Everybody in together now Shut the fuck up! What, huh? Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up! What's that? I didn't hear you Shut the fuck up! Come on, a little louder! Shut the fuck up! Everybody in together now Shut the fuck up! What, huh? Just shut the fuck up, just shut the fuck up!  [Outro: Method Man] It was over your head \u2013 all day, every day S.I.N.Y. 10304 Wu-Tang Killa Bees And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T Y'all know the time, y'all know the rhyme It ain't easy bein' greazy in a world full of cleanliness And, you know, all that other madness We gone, peace! Limp Bizkit, Method Man Rock the house y'all! Bring it on!  ",
