If we stop to gaze upon a star People talk about how bad we are... Ours is not an easy age We're like tigers in a cage What a Town Without Pity can do..  The young have problems Many problems We need an understanding heart.. Why don't they help us, try to help us Before this clay and granite planet falls apart...  Take these eager lips and hold me fast.. I'm afraid this kind of joy can't last How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two.. What a town Without Pity can do..  How can we keep love alive How can anything survive When these little minds tear you in two.. What a town Without Pity can do..  ",

And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they swore they'ed get him but the devil got him first  Roaring out of Harlan; revving up his mill He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville With G men on his tail light; road block up ahead The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread  Blazing right through Knoxville, out on Kingston Pike Then right outside of Bearden, they made the fatal strike He left the road at 90; that's all there is to say The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day  And there was thunder, thunder over \"Thunder Road\" Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load And there was moonshine, moonshine to quench the devil's thirst The law they never got him 'cause the devil got him first  ",
