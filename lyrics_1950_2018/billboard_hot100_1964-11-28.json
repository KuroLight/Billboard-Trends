Is he picking you up after school today? -M-m -By the way, where'd you meet him?  [Verse 1] I met him at the candy store He turned around and smiled at me You get the picture? -Yes, we see That's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack  My folks were always putting him down -Down, down They said he came from the wrong side of town -What you mean when you say that he came from the wrong side of town? They told me he was bad But I knew he was sad That's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack  One day my Dad said, \"Find someone new\" I had to tell my Jimmy, We're through -What you mean when you say that you better go find somebody new? He stood there and asked me why But all I could do was cry I'm sorry I hurt you, Leader of the Pack  He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye The tears were beginning to show As he drove away on that rainy night I begged him to go slow Whether he heard I'll never know  No, no, no, no, no, no, no Look out, look out, look out, look out  I felt so helpless, what could I do? Remembering all the things we'd been through In school they all stop and stare I can't hide the tears, but I don't care I'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack  Leader of the Pack, now he's gone  ",

How to tell you I'm not free? How can I bear to see your heart break To see your heart break over me  Amore scusami se sto piangendo Amore scusami, ma ho capito che lasciandoti io soffriro  Amore baciami, arrivederci amore baciami E se mi penserai ricordati che amo te  Ti ricordi quella sera che per gioco ti bacia? Sembrava solo un'avventura, un'avventura in riva al mar Ti baciavo nel silenzio, non volevo confessar Che stavo forse a poco a poco innamorandomi di te  My love, forgive me  I didn't mean to have it end like this I didn't mean to have you fall in love, in love with me  My love, please kiss me Arrivederci amore, kiss me Though we're apart, you'll still be in my heart I love so, I love so, I love so  ",
