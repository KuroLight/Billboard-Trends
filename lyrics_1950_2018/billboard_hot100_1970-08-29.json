Am I going crazy Or is this just a dream? Now wait a minute - I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere So it's all in my head And then I heard her say ...one more time:  Spill the wine take that pearl  I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared But soon she returned In her hand was a bottle of wine In the other, a glass She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And just before she drunk it She said:  Take the wine, take that pearl Spill the wine, take that pearl  ",
