[Verse 2: Eminem] Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade It just might make you sick, so irate With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit\u2014narrow minded But go through such a wide range of this emotion That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway With his personal memoir, saying \"He's bi!\" Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride Making him cry, \"Rape!\"\u2014then arrive naked And drive straight through the gay pride parade \"Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!\", 'cause here I\u2014 Wait, did the world just pee on my leg? And should I take it as a sign Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!) I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger To take the attention away From my stinking face it was bringing Changed the whole complexion of the game But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely? Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may Need some Flonase when he's speaking? What kind of stupid question is that? \"Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
