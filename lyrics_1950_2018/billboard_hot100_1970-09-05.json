Am I going crazy Or is this just a dream? Now wait a minute - I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere So it's all in my head And then I heard her say ...one more time:  Spill the wine take that pearl  I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back As she disappeared But soon she returned In her hand was a bottle of wine In the other, a glass She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass And raised it to her lips And just before she drunk it She said:  Take the wine, take that pearl Spill the wine, take that pearl  ",

And in the dungeons of your mind Who you got chained to the wall?  Tell it all brother, before we fall Tell it all brothers and sisters Tell it all  Did you plant your feet on higher ground To avoid life's mud and stone? Did you ever kick a good man When he was down, just to make yourself feel strong?  Tell it all brother, before we fall Tell it all brothers and sisters Tell it all  Tomorrow just might be too late Now is the time To get your jumbled mind straight And seek a new design  Did you ever walk before a crippled man Pretending you were lame? And what made you think one feeble hymn to God Was gonna make him call your name?  Tell it all brother and sisters Tell, Tell it all Tell it all brother, before we fall Tell it all brothers and sisters, tell Tell it all brother, before we fall Tell it all...  ",
