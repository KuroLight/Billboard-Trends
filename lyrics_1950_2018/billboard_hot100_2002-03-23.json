You can go on with your day to day Trying to forget what you saw in his face Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace What if he's an angel?

What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven And she's making certain that you're doing your best To take the time to help one another Brother are you going to pass that test?  You can go on with your day to day Trying to forget what you saw in her face Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace But what if she's an angel?

I took her back Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that Enough to make me wanna murder Momma, please just get my bail I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself  [Bridge: Justin Timberlake] And we all just entertainers And we're stupid and contagious And we all just entertainers  [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you I just can't crack your code One day you screamin' you love me loud The next day you're so cold One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care You're so unfair Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over Holy Grail  [Verse 2: Jay Z] Now I got tattoos on my body Psycho bitches in my lobby I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi Can't even take my daughter for a walk See 'em by the corner store I feel like I'm cornered off Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though? I'm gettin' high, sittin' low Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window This fame hurt, but this chain worse I think back you asked the same person If this is all you had to deal with Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt Niggas dying back where I was birthed Fuck your iris and the IRS Get the hell up off your high horse You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours Why you mad? Take the good with the bad Or throw the baby out with that bath water  [Bridge: Jay Z] You still alive, still that nigga Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller  [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you I just can't crack your code One day you screamin' you love me loud The next day you're so cold One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care You're so unfair Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over Holy Grail  [Bridge: Justin Timberlake] You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it And you take the blade right out my heart Just so you can watch me bleed And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah And you play this game in spite to drive me insane I got it tattooed on my sleeve Forever in ink with guess whose name But I still don't know why, why our love is so much  [Chorus: Justin Timberlake] And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you I just can't crack your code One day you screamin' you love me loud The next day you're so cold One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care You're so unfair Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over Holy Grail  ",
