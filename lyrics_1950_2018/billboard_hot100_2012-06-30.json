What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know anymore  [Verse 1] This is it, boys, this is war What are we waiting for? Why don't we break the rules already? I was never one to believe the hype Save that for the black and white Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked But here they come again to jack my style And that's alright, I found a martyr in my bed tonight She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, who I am, who I am Oh, who am I?  [Hook] Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end 'Cause I could use some friends for a change And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again Some nights, I always win (I always win) But I still wake up, I still see your ghost Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for What do I stand for? What do I stand for? Most nights, I don't know  [Bridge] So this is it? I sold my soul for this? Washed my hands of that for this? I miss my mom and dad for this? No When I see stars, when I see stars, that's all they are When I hear songs, they sound like a swan So come on Oh, come on Oh, come on Oh, come on  [Verse 2] Well, that is it, guys, that is all Five minutes in and I'm bored again Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands This one is not for the folks back home Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?  [Verse 3] My heart is breaking for my sister And the con that she called \"love\" And then I look into my nephew's eyes Man, you wouldn't believe the most amazing things That can come from some terrible nights  [Outro] The other night, you wouldn't believe The dream I just had about you and me I called you up, but we'd both agree It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance It's for the best you didn't listen It's for the best we get our distance, oh  ",

Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true? You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you? And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright  [Verse 2: Lil Wayne] So much for being optimistic They say love is in the air, so I Hold my breath until my face turn purple Keep a few bad bitches in my circle My nuts hang like ain't no curfew Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you I flew jet, she flew commercial But we still met later that night After my session, she came over I was aggressive and she was sober I gave her pills, she started confessing And started undressing and ask me to hold her And so I did, but that was last month And now she's texting me asking for closure Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me I keep tissue paper We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table She say she hate that she love me And she wish I was average Shit, sometimes I wish the same And I wish she wasn't married Promises, I hope I never break 'em Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation But, interviews are like confessions Get the fuck up out my bedroom Confusing me with questions like...  [Hook: Lil Wayne (& Drake)] Do you love this shit? Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous? Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true? You getting money?
