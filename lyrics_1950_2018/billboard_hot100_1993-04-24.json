Change what I put, slavery you need to be free  Chorus:  So maybe you need to swing my way Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way I'm the one you should chose Girl you won't be abused So maybe you need to swing my way Maybe you need to swing my way Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way Not like the man you're with now, I keep my hands to myself So maybe you need to swing my way  Verse Two:  Mistreated you like a towel And when he gets busted he thinks that he's an owl Your eye is puffy, your jaw is swollen You shouldn't be smacked, you're made to cuddle and hold an Cores and snuggle like a Teddy Bear His attitude's changed, begins to put fear In your heart, but you depart from being afraid Many thoughts of leaving were crushed so you stayed Saying what he did before he won't do again He wants more of a lover and less of a friend Catch my drift? You're put to the test so You refuse and get struck with a left blow He tells you in a flame way \"That's what you get for rejecting your man\" Hey Now you're crying on the floor Your man's no damn good, need I say more?  Chorus  Verse Three:  Now I'm not saying I'm an angel, I got many associates I treat them all right and appropriate I'm not talking marriage and settling down But I can treat you much better than that clown No matter what I say you still seem to protect him No matter the amount of times you're hit you respect him Damn, if you only knew How much affection could be given to you If you move the right way which is my way Forget what your so-called-boyfriend might say You're too good for his kind Widen your horizons and focus your mind On a real man. I won't stress you or keep sweating it I'll buy your clothes but pay your rent it's kind of pressin it So tell me, who do you chose? Here's an alter way then either win or can lose  Chorus (x4)  Maybe you need to swing my way  ",
