Taking any chance that comes along Getting hard to tell what's right or wrong I only wish I had a friend  And I'm livin' in desperate times Being alive's my only crime Don't care what I have to do I'll find some way to make it through Oh, and I'm livin' in desperate times And it's too late to change my mind Till these desperate times are done, gonna run Watch me run  ",

Hyperactive when I'm small Hyperactive now I'm grown Hyperactive and the night is young And in a minute I'll blow  Semaphore out on the floor Messages from outer space Deep heat for the feet And the rhythm of your heartbeat Cause the music of the street It isn't any rapattack It isn't any rapattack  I can reach into your homes Like an itch in your headphones You can't turn it up I'm the shape in your back room I'm the breather on the phone And I'm burning up But there's one thing I must say Before they lock me up again You'd be safer at the back When I'm having an attack  Hyperactive when I'm small Hyperactive now I'm tall Hyperactive as the day is long Hyperactive in my bones Hyperactive in your phones Hyperactive and the night is young Hyperactive when I'm small Hyperactive now I'm grown Hyperactive 'til I'm dead and gone  Stand up, hyperactivate Get up, hyperactivate Wise up, hyperactivate London, hyperactivate  ",
