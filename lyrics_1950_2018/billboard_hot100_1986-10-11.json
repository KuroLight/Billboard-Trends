You cried but I don't know how I've heard it all before There it goes again The slamming of the door Sometimes the river calls me And at night it calls my name Says, ''Put your troubles down beside me'' Things have always been the same And rock 'n' roll won't teach me What the river said that night I jumped into this beauty And drifted out of sight Where did your heart go?
