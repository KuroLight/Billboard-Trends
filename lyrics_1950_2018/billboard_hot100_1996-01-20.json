Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  So afraid to love you But more afraid to lose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Where once there was a darkness Deep and endless night You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me life  [Chorus] And I will remember you, will you remember me?

Nigga, what's up?!\") And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip For no reason at all I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at 3 Wondering, \"Why is everybody always pickin' on me? I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared To deal with scrappin' no doubt My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown I'm not tryin' to show no macho is shown But when it's on, if it's on, then it's on  [Hook] Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away Can't keep running away  [Verse 2: Slim Kid Tre] One, two... so listen here...

I gotta check my mind... Am I in tune with you? Do we connect within the realm of the gods? Electric word \"life\" that means forever And thats a mighty long time when you've kissed divine So divine...as with you The Christ within will come in the clouds Trusting \"divinity is always with me\" Trusting \"this is the here and now\" Mercy's right...I gotta check my love And I'm trying to do as such I don't let the demons get me down It's just that sometimes I miss you so much...  I can envision all things to life I can understand realistic ways But I invent the next phase in forever I like you, rewrite the next page It's so pristine...it's so untouched I'm an emmaculate sign of devotion Still unseen...I'm thinking so what Bless me cursed with colorful emotions God said \"I guess you don't know I'm you Because you know the entire 360\" A Christ that's me A Christ that's you Reguardless...constantly within me I'm so not responsible for this I'm just a man in love with so much I know love...you'll always be with me It's just sometimes I miss you so much  ",
