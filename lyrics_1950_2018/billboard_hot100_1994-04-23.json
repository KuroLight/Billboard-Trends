Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof To kick the truth to the young black youth But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted That what? That life is hectic  [Chorus: Method Man] Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M., get the money Dollar dollar bill, y'all Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M., get the money Dollar dollar bill, y'all  [Bridge: Inspectah Deck] Niggas got to do what they got to do To get through, know what I'm sayin'? Because you can't just get by no more Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down  [Chorus: Method Man] Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M., get the money Dollar dollar bill, y'all Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M., get the money Dollar dollar bill, y'all  ",

Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors Kids look up to me like a skyscraper Now, a role model, I mean a role figure Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger? My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me \"Remember this, son, you are the one Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from You're young, gifted, and Black If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, Shaq!'\" Like the fam do, in the stands too When I freak the funk on a dunk they, \"Ahhh! Oooh!\" From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge Make that gift and now it's Time for me to fulfill my dream To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem I'll make the backboards shatter Fans chit-chatter Even make the other centers get madder That's me, who can it be? The master of disaster, seven foot three Brother, ain't no other in the nation I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation I'm outstanding  [Interlude] I'm outstanding  [Verse 3] Cause now I'm outstanding Wave your hands and pump your fist When I'm on the court you know it's strictly, \"Swish!\" Cause there's some things that I gotta do: Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq shoe And now it's time to take care of business To run up and down the court with Nick and Dennis Scott, but I won't stop Gotta keep striving until I reach the top Gonna take a peek over the mountain I flow like a fountain Peace, I gotta go!

Get out of my way!  [Verse 2] Question: Why is it that every time I walk into the bank The tellers look at me Like I'm the one that robbed them last week?  [Chorus] Come on, man Funk dat! What are you lookin' at?  [Verse 3] Question: Why is it that every time I turn on the radio I hear the same 5 songs 15 times a day, for 3 months?  [Chorus] Man... Funk dat! Get a new DJ!  [Verse 4] Question: Why is it that bums ask me for money When I ain't got none? What is it an \"in\" thing or something? Let me remind this dude he ain't got no money, hm?  [Chorus] Man... Funk dat! Get a job!  [Verse 5] You know Every time I see my neighbor She tells me to stay out of trouble The other one looks at me Like I'm the one that got her daughter strung out  [Chorus] Come on, man Funk dat! What are you lookin' at?  [Verse 6] Seems like every time It never fails, it never fails I'm just chillin' in my crib Mindin' my on business And somebody wants to call me just to talk about nothin'  [Chorus] Funk dat! Get a life!  [Verse 7] Question: Why is it that when I go out to a nightclub Only the ugly chicks want to step to me? I mean, like I'm ugly or somethin', huh? What you mean, huh?  [Chorus] Funk dat!
