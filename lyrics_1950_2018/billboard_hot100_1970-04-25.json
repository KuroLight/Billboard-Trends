Can you tell me where Nat has gone? The last thing I heard him say, he was gonna look back over his life & before he could do it, he was gone Oh before he could do it, he was gone  & has anybody here seen my friend Sam Cooke Can anybody tell me where Sam has gone? The last thing he told me, that a change was gonna come But before he could see it, he was gone Oh before he could see it, he was gone  I've got another friend by the name of Otis Redding Can anybody tell me where Otis has gone? Last time I saw him, he was sittin' down by the dock of the bay I looked around for Otis & he was gone I looked around & my friend Otis Redding was gone  Hmmmm hmmmm oh I have to moan about it sometime, hmmmm & that makes me know I've got to leave here one day But I don't worry about it, for you know why I've got friends, oh yes I have, waitin' on me You know what they're gonna say when I get there? They will say, 'Come on in, Pickett. Sit down & rest awhile I know you're tired; I know you came from a mighty long ways I know you've had hard times, I know you had to give up life for long Come on in, don't worry no more, we will stand by you, we will never let you down Come on in, come on in, sit down, sit down' ... & fade  ",

About five years ago -- I fell in love But you know I never believed -- I never believed in working a real hard job But one day my old lady walked up and told me -- and said Bobby She said your lovin' is good -- But my money is gettin' sort of thin Lemme hear ya say yeah  She said, \"I don't mean to hurt your feelings, boy,\" \"But you better get ooonnnn out -- and find yourself a job!\" My nose was sort of opened wide at that time So early that next morning I went ooonnnn out -- lookin' -- Tryin to find a job -- And I'm mighty glad to today to tell you that I found it I put in 24 hours a day -- And then a little bit overtime And here's the sad part of the story  You know something about that, don't you? Listen to me, now What brought me home -- It brought me home sort of early one night, huh I got a funny -- I got a funny -- feeeling That somethimg wasn't going on in my house that wasn't right Until I recognized my old lady's voice -- And she kept tellin' she said -- Oooh, baby! And I was steady listenin' she said -- Oooh, baby! And he sort of stuttering too -- He kept sayin, like, Uh, what, honey? She kept tellin' him -- look, keep on doin' doin' doin' What youre doin' boy!

Would ya do me one thing...?\"  Girl don't pull the rug from under my feet -- OOOHHH Don't leave, don't leave me so, I'm talking in my sleep This could be the start of a nightmare Waking up and not finding you there It would be more that I could stand  Oh, baby Oh, baby Girl, don't leave me so I'm pacing the floor (don't you do it baby) Cause that's, that's what I'll do if you close the door Leavin' me would ruin all of my plans It would be like tying the both of my hands And that's more than I could ever stand Cause that's more than I could stand  Why you wanna leave me? Why you wanna go? I promise not To never, never hurt you no more  Oh, please don't leave me Please don't go By causin' my heart to ache Causin' it to break  I beleive we've still got, a lot of love to give, baby So turn around, baby (turn around) While there's a lot of life we can live Maybe I've been too hung up on myself But don't change me by putting my heart on a shelf Cause that's more than I could everstand  Oh tell me, Oh tell me Why you wanna leave me? -- Why you wanna go?
