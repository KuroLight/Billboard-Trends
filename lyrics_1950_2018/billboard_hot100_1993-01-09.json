He asked for it His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be....check it out now I ain't goin' out, man that short shit is dead Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread He got a cannon that's bad...similar to the one that I got from my own dad  Refrain 4x  [Verse 2 \u2013 Lord Jamar] Your punk ass'll be grass quick fast like my name was Flash When a nigga try and rob me for my cash You thought you had a sweet vic, a nice pick But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick Now who's the trick, cuz I'm not a ho. (No, no-no-no!) I always do the fuckin', just might do the buckin' I leave my Nikes stuck in your rectum, till you learn Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em Dissect 'em, yo, our word is bond regardless To my what, and do the Puma strut So step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face With the mothafuckin' bass! Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth, it's gonna flood south To the ground, and you're gonna know I don't fuck around So if you think you had two soft newjacks We're gonna have top off you with a few cracks To the jaw and you won't pop that shit no more Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor Did you want some more? I didn't think so Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire Lord Jamar will live long, cuz I give strong blows the heads of my foes Dread flows, gives me power as it grows Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot Heed not, and hell will be your home Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your dome  Refrain 4x  ",
