I see spots! The lines on the road just look like dots.\"  Took a corner; sideswiped a truck Crossed my fingers just for luck My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts The guy beside me was white as a ghost  Smoke was comin' from out of the back When I started to gain on that Cadillac Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?  We had flames comin' from out of the side Feel the tension. Man! What a ride! I said, \"Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!\" And that Caddy pulled over and let us by  Now all of a sudden she started to knockin' And down in the dips she started to rockin' I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin' The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!  They arrested me and they put me in jail And called my pappy to throw my bail And he said, \"Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin' If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!\"  ",

He'd begin to move, something like this: \"Dance... dance\". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look In the mirror: \"Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a Woman gotta find a woman\". He'd go down to the lake where all the Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look Around and just reach in and grab one. \"Come here... come here\" He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there Wet and frightened. He said: \"Move... move\". She got up. She was a Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said: \"Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!\". She looked down on him She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said (Falsetto): \"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". He said: \"Wha?\". She said (falsetto): \"I'll sock it to ya, Daddy\". You know what he said? He started it way Back then. I wouldn't lie to you.
