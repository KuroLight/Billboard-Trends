Where you going?\u201d, \u201cI'm leaving you.\u201d \u201cNo, you ain't Come back!\u201d We're runnin' right back, here we go again It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap, \u201cWho's that dude?\u201d, I don't even know his name I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe when you're with 'em? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin' Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  ",

I\u2019m gonna sit right here And tell you all that comes to me If you have something to say You should say it right now (Drake: You should say it right now)  You ready?  [Bridge] You give me a feeling that I never felt before And I deserve it, I think I deserve it (Drake: I deserve it, I think it deserve it..Let it go) It\u2019s becoming something that\u2019s impossible to ignore And I can\u2019t take it (Drake: I can\u2019t take it)  [Hook] I was wondering maybe Could I make you my baby If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy If you ask me I\u2019m ready (Echo: I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready) If you ask me I\u2019m ready (Echo: I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m ready)  [Verse 2: Alicia Keys] I know you once said to me \u201cThis is exactly how it should feel when it\u2019s meant to be\u201d Time is only wasting so why wait for eventually? If we gon\u2019 do something \u2019bout it We should do it right now (Drake: We should do it right now)  Bay, uh  [Bridge]  [Hook]  [Hook] Why give up before we try Feel the lows before the highs Clip our wings before we fly away I can\u2019t say I came prepared I\u2019m suspended in the air Won\u2019t you come be in the sky with me  [Hook] [End]  ",

Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, \"I just don't care\"?  [Verse 2] It's only half past the point of no return The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn The thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase Have you ever felt this way?  [Verse 3] Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry? Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm Out on the boulevard Something like a sunset Oh, you're a shooting star And I might drive myself insane If those lips aren't speaking my name  [Pre-Chorus] 'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down To counter this addiction You got me on a mission Tell me darling can I get a break some- How could I say no?  [Chorus] She's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh) Girl's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah) I kinda feel like it don't make sense 'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again Love so strong, then you moved on Now I'm hung up in suspense Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again  [Verse 2] It's like a hurricane, speed train She's a moving car Catch her in the fast lane, oh I gotta know Can I keep up with her pace? Kick it into gear when I see that face You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one That can make a storm cloud break Pulling out the sun And I can't get caught in the rain Can I get your lips to speak my name?  [Pre-Chorus] 'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down To counter this addiction You got me on a mission Tell me darling can I get a break some- How could I say no?  [Chorus] She's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh) Girl's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah) I kinda feel like it don't make sense 'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again Love so strong, then you moved on Now I'm hung up in suspense Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again  [Bridge] 'Cause we only have one life The timing and the moment all seem so right So would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine) Would you say you're mine? (We'll be just fine)  [Chorus] She's got a love like woe (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh) Girl's got a love like woe (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah) I kinda feel like it don't make sense 'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again Love so strong, then you moved on Now I'm hung up in suspense Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again  She's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh) Girl's got a love like woe! (Wo-oh, oh-oh ooh, ba-da-dah) I kinda feel like it don't make sense 'Cause you're bringing me in and now you're kicking me out again Love so strong, then you moved on Now I'm hung up in suspense Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again (again... again...)
