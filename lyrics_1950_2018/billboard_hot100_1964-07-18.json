Ain't nobody seen Your Johnny Dollar  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  There's a man next door With a radio and he plays it All through the night  There's a couple in the Apartment above my head That don't do nothing But fuss and fight  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  Tell me, where do you go When you got no dough? There must be a way Out of here  But I've got to find Some peace of mind There must be a place That I can find  Believe me when I tell you There's a cat that gets Under my window And he meows all the time  There's a drunk that wakes me In the middle of the night Singing 'Sweet Adeline'  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  Oh, I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me A quiet place  I got to get away from This noisy street  ",
