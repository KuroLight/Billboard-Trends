Please, don't be so ashamed I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know They won't get you like I will My only wish is I die real 'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still So you cry still, tears all on the pillowcase Big girls all get a little taste Pushing me away so I give her space Dealing with a heart that I didn't break I be there for you, I will care for you I keep thinking you just don't know Tryna run from that, say you done with that On your face, girl, it just don't show When you're ready, just say you're ready When all the baggage just ain't as heavy And the party's over, just don't forget me We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow You won't ever have to worry, you won't ever have to hide You've seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes  [Chorus: Rihanna] 'Cause if you let me Here is what I'll do I'll take care of you I've loved and I've lost  [Verse 2: Drake] It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to Can't deny that I want you but I'll lie if I have to Cause you don't say you love me to your friends when they ask you Even though we both know that you do...you do One time been in love one time You and all your girls in the club one time All so convinced that you're following your heart 'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know.. we know You hate being alone well you ain't the only one You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some To save you.. instead they say:  [Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron] Don't tell me, I don't care If you hurt, I don't tell you You don't care, if you're true Don't tell me, I don't care If you hurt, I don't tell you You don't care, if you're true  [Chorus: Rihanna] I know you've been hurt by someone else I can tell by the way you carry yourself If you let me, here's what I'll do I'll take care of you I've loved and I've lost  ",
