Where Steinbeck found the valley And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley And have you ever walked down through the sycamores Where the farmhouse used to be There the monarch's autumn journey ends On a windswept cyprus tree  [Chorus] Water get water get yourself in that Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place Get yourself in that water The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away Take your mind away Take your mind away  [Verse 3] Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation? Where Country Joe will do his show And he'd sing about liberty And the people there in the open air, one big family Yeah the people there love to sing and share Their new found liberty  ",

A sweetly-scented angel fell She laid her head upon my disbelief And bathed me with her ever-smile And with a howl across the sand I go escorted by a band of gentlemen in leather bound NO-ONE (but someone to be found)  Re-Assuring Tune Instrumental part  Memory Bank All along the icy wastes there are faces smiling in the gloom Roll up roll down, Feeling unwound? Step into the viewing room The cameras were all around. We've got you taped; you're in the play Here's your I.D. (Ideal for identifying one and all.) Invest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you The ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play  Take the prize for instant pleasure Captain of the cricket team Public speaking in all weathers A knighthood from a queen  Best Friends All of your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand There's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran Climb in your old umbrella Does it have a nasty tear in the dome?  But the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone  Critique Oblique Lover of the black and white it's your first night The Passion Play, goes all the way, spoils your insight Tell me how the baby's made, how the lady's laid Why the old dog howls in sadness  And your little sister's immaculate virginity wings away On the bony shoulders of a young horse named George Who stole surreptitiously into her geography revision (The examining body examined her body.)  Actor of the low-high Q, let's hear your view Peek at the lines upon your sleeves since your memory won't do Tell me: how the baby's graded, how the lady's faded Why the old dogs howl with madness  All of this and some of that's the only way to skin the cat And now you've lost a skin or two, you're for us and we for you The dressing room is right behind We've got you taped, you're in the play How does it feel to be in the play? How does it feel to play the play? How does it feel to be the play?  Man of passion rise again, we won't cross you out: For we do love you like a son, of that there's no doubt Tell us: is it you who are here for our good cheer? Or are we here for the glory, for the story, for the gory satisfaction Of telling you how absolutely awful you really are?
