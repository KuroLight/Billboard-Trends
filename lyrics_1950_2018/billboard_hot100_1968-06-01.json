You'll never, never, never reach the sky  {Instrumental}  You're soldiers of God, you must understand The fate of your country is in your young hands May God give you strength Do your job real well If it all was worth it Only time it will tell  In the morning they return With tears in their eyes The stench of death drifts up to the skies A soldier so ill looks at the sky pilot Remembers the words \"Thou shalt not kill.\" Sky pilot Sky pilot How high can you fly?
