I can fill that void When you spend time with your woman and listen It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt And prove to you you're more important than anything else Worthwhile, special like my first child When I see your face it's always like the first time Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to Let it be known, I told you And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true  [Hook]  [R.

Yes, a spectacle monopolized They hold the reins, stole your eyes All the Fist-a-gons, the bullets, and bombs Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks More for Gore or the son of a drug lord None of the above.
