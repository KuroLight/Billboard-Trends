You're my favorite girl Excuse me for the moment I'm in another world On a mountain, by a fountain Flowers blooming everywhere With Venus and with cupid The picture's very clear  [Hook] Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' Just a way to say that, I'm so into you And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove  [Verse 2] Erotic whispers for the listener Let the music fill the air Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words By election, sheer perfection And as if these eyes would care Your heart is in the right place So don't you go and change Baby over and over The passion starts again You're my lollipops and everything And a little taste of sin Causing fire and desire In this mortal soul to live 'Til the angels fall from Heaven And the day the earth stands still  [Hook] Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' Just a way to say that, I'm so into you And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove  [Interlude] When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove  [Bridge] Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood Can you feel it? (Uh huh) Baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off This time, it's time for me and you Are you ready? (Yes)  [Hook] Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove' Just a way to say that, I'm so into you And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove  [Outro] Close your eyes and let the music put you in the groove Lock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'  ",

I was walking down the street, rocking my beat Clapping my hands and stomping my feet I saw a little lady so neat and petite She was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet So I asked this lady could I take her out We could wine and dine and we could talk about The birds and the bees in my waterbed And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head We continued to talk, and before you knew it We were at my house and it was time to do it As soon as I finished, I lost my poise Ran outside and told all my boys I said \"Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it\" They said \"Did you get it?\" I said \"Yeah,\" they said \"How was it?\" The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her But three days later, go see the doctor  I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right She felt so good, hugged me so tight I said \"Good night\" Three days later... Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing I went to the bathroom and said \"Mama mia!\" I'ma kill that girl next time I see her The madder I got the more I reminisce Why is my thing thing burning like this? Well I remember the first day I saw that girl I just couldn't wait to rock her world I said \"Hey good looking, what you got cooking?\" What have I done stuck my dick in? Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave Calls her Mrs. Microwave 'Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn The hard way, stay in the microwave too long you get burned But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her But three days later, go see the doctor  I went to the doctor's office, I said \"What have I got?\" He said \"Turn around boy and take this shot\" I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said \"What? Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt\" He turned and said in a real deep voice \"Have it your way if that's your choice And I'll put it down if you want me to put it But don't blame me if it turns into a foot Extending from the middle of your body And the next time you see your cute hottie You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do Would just kick her, so go take karate\" As I turned around to receive my injection I said \"Next time I'll use some protection\" If I see another girl and I get an erection I'm walking in the other direction 'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor  ",
