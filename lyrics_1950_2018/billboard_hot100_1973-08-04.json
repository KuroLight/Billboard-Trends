I bet you he's even got a commie flag Tacked up on the wall inside of his garage.\" \"He's a snake in the grass, I tell you guys He may look dumb but that's just a disguise He's a mastermind in the ways of espionage\" They all started looking real suspicious at him And he jumped up and said \"Now just wait a minute Jim! You know he's lying I been living here all of my life!\" \"I'm a faithful follower of Brother John Birch And I belong to the Antioch Baptist Church And I ain't even got a garage, you can call home and ask my wife!\" Then he started saying something bout the way I was dressed But I didn't wait around to hear the rest I was too busy moving and hoping I didn't run out of luck When I hit the ground I was making tracks And they were just taking my car down off the jacks So I threw the man a twenty and jumped in and fired that mother up Mario Andretti would be sure been proud Of the way I was moving when I passed that crowd Coming out the door and headed toward me at a trot And I guess I should of gone ahead and run But somehow I just couldn't resist the fun Of chasing them all just once around the parking lot Well they headed for their car, but I hit the gas And spun around and headed them off at the pass I was slinging gravel and putting a ton of dust in the air I had them all out there stepping and fetching Like their heads was on fire and their asses was catching Then I figured I had better go ahead and split before the cops got there When I hit the road I was really wheeling Had gravel flying and rubber squealing And I didn't slow down till I was almost to Arkansas I think I'm going to reroute my trip I wonder if anybody'd think I'd flipped If I went to L.A., via Omaha  ",

Puff, Puff, Puff and if you smoke yourself to death Tell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate That you hate to make him wait But you've just got to have another cigarette  Now I'm a feller with a heart of gold And the ways of a gentleman, I've been told The kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea-- But if me and a certain character met The guy that invented the cigarette I'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree-- Not 'cause I don't smoke myself And I don't reckon they'll harm your health I've smoked all my life and ain't dead yet But nicotine slaves are all the same At a pettin' party or a poker game Everything must stop while they smoke that cigarette  In a game of chance the other night Old Dame Fortune was a-doin' me right The Kings and Queens just kept on comin' around-- I played 'em hard and bet 'em high But my bluff didn't work on a certain guy He kept on raisin' and layin' the money down He'd raise me and I'd raise him I sweated blood gotta sink or swim He finally called and didn't raise the bet-- I said \"Aces full, pal,--how 'bout you?\" He said \"I'll tell you in a minute or two Right now I've just got to have a cigarette.\"  The other night I had a date With the cutest little girl in the forty eight states A high-bred, uptown, fancy little dame-- She said she loved me and it seemed to me That things were 'bout like they oughta be So hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane-- She was oh, so far from a cake of ice Our smoochin' party was a-goin nice So help me Hannah, I think I'd a been there yet-- But I give her a kiss and a little squeeze And she said \"Tex excuse me please I've just got to have another cigarette.\"  Well life ain't nothing but a poker game No two hands quite the same But I never saw a winner that didn't bet  So if any people tryin' to quit I ain't gonna criticize you one bit Just make mine a Jamaican cigarette  ",
