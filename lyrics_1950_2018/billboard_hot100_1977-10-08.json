So she joined up with her outlaw And headed for California  He treated her worse than she'd ever imagined He didn't say he didn't want her around He kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong He run her right into the ground  After five long years He picked her up and slapped her down  Then she told her friends about him They all were on her side But she could see through the haze he looked so pale She put her head right down and she cried  For her poor lover She cried like a mother for her poor lover  And now she lives on a mountain top And she's almost thirty-five And she's found her peace and found her release Happy just to be alive  And she might go back to her Floyd If she thinks it's the thing to do He gave up murder and theft after she left And you know she still loves him to Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe Just like a worn out shoe  Well they call her avenging Annie The avenger of womanhood She spends her whole life telling lies Leads them on a mess and over good  ",
