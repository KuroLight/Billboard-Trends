You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me  It's much too late to find You think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry  [Chorus: Philip] Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?  [Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley] I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar That much is true But even then I knew I'd find a much better place Either with or without you  The five years we have had have been such good times I still love you But now I think it's time I live my life on my own I guess it's just what I must do  [Pre-Chorus: Philip] Don't, don't you want me? You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me Don't, don't you want me? You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me  It's much too late to find You think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry  [Chorus: Philip] Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?  [Instrumental Break]  [Chorus: Philip][repeat till fade] Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, ohh?  ",
