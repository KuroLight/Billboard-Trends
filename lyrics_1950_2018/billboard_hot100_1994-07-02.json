Kids at play!\"  Those were the rites of spring and we did everything; There was salvation every night We got dreams reborn and our upholstery torn But everything we tried was right  She used her body just like a bandage She use my body just like a wound I'll probably never know where she disappeared But I can see rising up out of the back seat now Just like an angel rising out of a tomb  But it was long ago, and it was far away Oh God, it seems so very far And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car  [X9] And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are  [Outro] She used her body just like a bandage She used my body just like a wound I'll probably never know where she disappeared But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now...

I got nothing but love for you, honey (Yeah, whatever)  [Heavy D] So nobody dis the champion So nobody dis the champion  [Verse 3: Heavy D] You give me feelings like I'm dealing with a crooked hand You got a grand from a man cause you shook his hand You're well known in the streets, in the gutters So fly, when you caught my eye, you made me stutter You come around with your curls and your pretty pearls You even been around the world, so you go, girl But where's the love at Tell me where's the hugs at Acting like a Rugrat I know where you bought that Don't try to gas me, girl, I know the streets well You're money hungry And you're making trick-n-treats sell So leave it up to me I'll close the whole damn store on you I got nothing but love for you  [Hook - until fade] I got nothing but love for you, baby (Uh-huh) I got nothing but love for you, honey (Yeah, whatever) I got nothing but love for you, baby (What you got?)
