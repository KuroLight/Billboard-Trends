I've been here times before But I was too blind to see That you seduce every man This time you won't seduce me She's saying: \"That's okay Hey baby, do what you please I have the stuff that you want I am the thing that you need.\" She looked me deep in the eyes She's touching me so to start She says: \"There's no turning back.\" She trapped me in her heart  [Hook] Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, no Dirty Diana, let me be! Oh no, oh no, oh no  [Verse 2] She likes the boys in the band She knows when they come to town Every musician's fan After the curtain comes down She waits at backstage doors For those who have prestige Who promise fortune and fame A life that's so carefree She's saying: \"That's okay Hey baby, do what you want I'll be your night-loving thing I'll be the freak you can taunt And I don't care what you say I want to go too far I'll be your everything If you make me a star.\"  [Hook] Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, no Dirty Diana Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, no Dirty Diana Diana, Diana Dirty Diana It's Diana  [Verse 3] She said: \"I have to go home 'Cause I'm real tired you see But I hate sleeping alone Why don't you come with me?\" I said: \"My baby's at home She's probably worried tonight I didn't call on the phone To say that I'm alright.\" Diana walked up to me She said: \"I'm all yours tonight.\" At that I ran to the phone Saying, \"Baby, I'm alright.\" I said: \"But unlock the door 'Cause I forgot the key.\" She said: \"He's not coming back Because he's sleeping with me.\"  [Hook] Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, no Dirty Diana Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, nah Dirty Diana, no Dirty Diana Diana, Diana Dirty Diana It's Diana  ",

Sweet child o' mine Oh! Oh! Oh, oh! Sweet love of mine  [Verse 2] She's got eyes of the bluest skies As if they thought of rain I hate to look into those eyes And see an ounce of pain Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place Where as a child I'd hide And pray for the thunder and the rain To quietly pass me by  [Chorus] Oh, oh, oh!

And the night rolls on I search for some piece of mind No, I can't be wrong Won't get burned by desire this time  Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one Wait on love, won't hold back I promised myself, till it comes... Gonna wait on love  Wanna get close with somebody When a voice says I'm movin' too fast It's hard to know when to walk away Or try to make it last...... Still the night rolls on Secrets are safe in the dark And I stayed too long I'm not gonna lie to my heart  Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one Wait on love, won't hold back I promised myself, till it comes... Gonna wait on love  Someone I can run to Just know that it's right Trust my heart and soul to For the rest of my life....  ",
