(Put them up, put  them up) (Put them up, put  them up) (Put them up, put  them up)  [Verse 1] It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend The one you let hit it and never called you again 'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins? You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend Like you wasn't down and you called him again? Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin? Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem Baby girl, respect is just a minimum Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em Now, Lauryn is only human Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans Fake nails done by Koreans Come again  [Hook] Guys you know you'd better watch out Some girls, some girls are only about That thing, that thing, that thing That thing, that thing, that thing  [Verse 2] The second verse is dedicated to the men More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!) Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men Need to take care of they three or four kids And they face a court case when the child support late Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men The sneaky, silent men The punk, domestic violence men Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men How you gonna win when you ain't right within? How you gonna win when you ain't right within? How you gonna win when you ain't right within?

From the hospital that first night Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right People driving all fast, got me kinda upset Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet That night I don't think one wink I slept As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt Cause I know I loved you more than life itself Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please Let me be a good daddy, all he needs Love, knowledge, discipline too I pledge my life to you  [Chorus] Just the two of us, we can make it if we try Just the two of us, (Just the two of us) Just the two of us, building castles in the sky Just the two of us, you and I  [Verse 2: Will Smith] Five years old, bringin comedy Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be A general, a doctor, maybe a MC Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that Uh-uh-uh why you do that? I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy I pledge to you, I will always do Everything I can, show you how to be a man Dignity, integrity, honor an' I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it An you can cry, ain't no shame it it It didn't work out with me an your mom But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love So if the world attacks, and you slide off track Remember one fact, I got your back  [Chorus] Just the two of us, we can make it if we try Just the two of us, (Just the two of us) Just the two of us, building castles in the sky Just the two of us, you and I  [Verse 3] It's a full-time job to be a good dad You got so much more stuff than I had I gotta study just to keep with the changin times 101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know On my PC where that CD go But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone Feel the strife, but trust life does go on But just in case, it's my place to impart One day some girl's gonna break your heart And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son Throughout life people will make you mad Disrespect you and treat you bad Let God deal with the things they do Cause hate in your heart will consume you too Always tell the truth, say your prayers Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears You're living proof that dreams do come true I love you and I'm here for you  [Hook] [Chorus] Just the two of us, we can make it if we try Just the two of us, (Just the two of us) Just the two of us, building castles in the sky Just the two of us, you and I  [Outro: Trey Smith] (This is a good song dad, how much am I gettin paid for this?)
