Who cares about little boys That talk too much? I've seen it all go down The game of love was all rained out So come on, baby, come on over Let me be the one to hold you  I'm the one who wants to be with you Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too Waited on a line of greens and blues Just to be the next to be with you  Why be alone when we can be together, baby? You can make my life worth while I can make you start to smile When it's through, it's through And fate will twist the both of you So come on, baby, come on over Let me be the one to show you  I'm the one who wants to be with you Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too Waited on a line of greens and blues Just to be the next to be with you  I'm the one who wants to be with you Deep inside I hope you'll feel it too Waited on a line of greens and blues Just to be the next to be with you Just to be the next to be with you  ",
