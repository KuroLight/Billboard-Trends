But see I know that you may be Just a bit jealous of me But you're blind if you can't see That his love is all in me See, I tried to hesitate I didn't want to say what he told me He said without me he couldn't make it Through the day, ain't that a shame But maybe you misunderstood 'Cause I can't see how he could Wanna change something that's so good All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)  [Chorus: Monica & Brandy] You need to give it up Had about enough (enough) It's not hard to see The boy is mine (boy is mine) I'm sorry that you (sorry that you) Seem to be confused (confused) He belongs to me The boy is mine  [Verse 2: Monica & Brandy] Must you do the things you do You keep on acting like a fool You need to know it's me not you And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true I think that you should realize And try to understand why He is a part of my life I know it's killing you inside You can say what you wanna say What we have you can't take From the truth you can't escape I can tell the real from the fake When will you get the picture? You're the past, I'm the future Get away, it's my time to shine If you didn't know the boy is mine (the boy is mine)  [Chorus: Monica & Brandy] You need to give it up Had about enough (enough) It's not hard to see (to see) The boy is mine (the boy is mine) I'm sorry that you (sorry that you) Seem to be confused (seem to be confused) He belongs to me (he belongs to me) The boy is mine (the boy is mine) You need to give it up Had about enough (had about enough) It's not hard to see The boy is mine (he's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine) I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry) Seem to be confused (you seem to be confused) He belongs to me (he belongs to me) The boy is mine  [Verse 3: Monica & Brandy] You can't destroy this love I've found Your silly games I won't allow The boy is mine without a doubt You might as well throw in the towel What makes you think that he wants you When I'm the one that brought him to The special place that's in my heart? He was my love right from the start  [Chorus: Monica & Brandy] You need to give it up (baby don't lie) Had about enough (had about enough) It's not hard to see (it's not hard to see) The boy is mine (the boy is mine) I'm sorry that you (I'm sorry that you) Seem to be confused (seem to be confused) He belongs to me (he belongs to me) The boy is mine (no, no) You need to give it up (you need to give it up) Had about enough (had enough) It's not hard to see (it's not hard to see) The boy is mine (the boy is mine) I'm sorry that you Seem to be confused (seem to be confused) He belongs to me (he belongs to me) The boy is mine (the boy is mine) You need to give it up (not yours) Had about enough (but mine, not yours) It's not hard to see (but mine, not yours) The boy is mine (but mine) I'm sorry that you Seem to be confused He belongs to me The boy is mine  ",
