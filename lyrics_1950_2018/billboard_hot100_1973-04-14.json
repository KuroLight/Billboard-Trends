Stowin' away the time? Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?  Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time? Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?  You've been telling me you're a genius since you were seventeen In all the time I've known you, I still don't know what you mean The weekend at the college didn't turn out like you planned The things that pass for knowledge, I can't understand  Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time? Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?  Are you reelin' in the years? Stowin' away the time? Are you gatherin' up the tears? Have you had enough of mine?  I've spent a lot of money, and I've spent a lot of time The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind After all the things we've done and seen, you find another man The things you think are useless, I can't understand  Are you reelin' in the years?
