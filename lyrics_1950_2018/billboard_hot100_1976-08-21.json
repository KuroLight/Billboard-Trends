I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge And she and Billie Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\"  A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billie Joe And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything And me - I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge  ",

When will there be? I wanna know now, now When will there be, a harvest? When will there be, a harvest? When will there be, a harvest? When will there be, a harvest? When will there be, a harvest? When will there be, a harvest? When will there be? When will there be? Everybody, talking bout the children When will there be, a harvest? When will there be?  ",
