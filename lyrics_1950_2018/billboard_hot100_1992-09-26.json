In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street But only you saw what took many time to see I dedicate this to you for believing in me Rain or shine, yes in any weather My grandmom Pam holds the family together My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest I strive to be live cause I got no choice And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due When they reminisce over you, listen  [Outro: Pete Rock] Listen, just listen To the funky song as I rock on And that's word is bond I'm not playin Everybody, just coolin This song we dedicate To the one and only Never be another He was my brother Trouble T-Roy It's like that y'all And you don't stop Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92 And we out, later  ",
