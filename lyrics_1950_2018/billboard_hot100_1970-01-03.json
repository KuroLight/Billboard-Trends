You keep on holding me back You keep on holding on You keep on picking on me You keep on holding me back You keep on holding on You keep on holding on You're holding me back I wonder why, you do me like that But you keep on holding me back You keep on putting your foot on me But I, I've got to break away Somehow and someday Cause I wanna be somebody so bad, so bad I wanna be somebody, I wanna be somebody so bad You see, I want diamond rings and things, like you do And I wanna drive Cadillac cars I wanna be somebody so bad But you keep on putting your foot on me And I, I believe, I believe I can break away And be somebody, somehow, and someway  Ya see, I heard somebody say one time You can make it, if you try And some of us, we tried so hard, we tried so hard I want you to know that I don't speak for myself But I speak for y'all too right now Ya see, if you have white-like brown skin and a high yeller You're still black So we all got to stick together right now This I wanna say to you my sisters and my brothers Right on sister Right on brother  Dig this: And we keep on pushing down We've got to make it a little bit further We've got to make it a little further All we got to do is try, try, try And some of us, we've tried so hard We've tried so hard, we've tried so hard We've tried so hard, so hard to be somebody We've tried so hard, although, they're holding us back And it stairs the reason, that they're doing us like that You know what?
