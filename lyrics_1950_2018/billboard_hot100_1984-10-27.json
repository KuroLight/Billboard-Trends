We're really not so clever as we seem to think we are We've always got our troubles so we solve them in the bar As the days go by, we seem to drift apart If I could only find a way to keep hold of your heart  [Chorus] Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far Do you know there's something wrong 'Cause I've felt it all along  [Verse 3] Sitting in the valley as I watch the sun go down I can see you there Thinking of a reason, well, it's really not very hard To love you even though you nearly lost my heart When will we know when the change is gonna come I've got a good feeling and it's coming from the sun  [Chorus] Sitting on a pebble by the river playing guitar Wond'ring if we're really ever gonna get that far Do you know there's something wrong We'll stick together 'cause we're strong  ",

In the name of love What more in the name of love?  [Guitar Riff] Nothing like love There's nothing like love Nobody like you  [Verse 3] Early morning, April four Shot rings out in the Memphis sky Free at last, they took your life They could not take your pride  [Chorus] In the name of love What more in the name of love? In the name of love What more in the name of love?  [Chorus] In the name of love What more in the name of love? In the name of love What more in the name of love?  ",
