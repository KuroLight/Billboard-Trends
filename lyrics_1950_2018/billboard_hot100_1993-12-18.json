It's all about soul  She turns to me sometimes and she asks me what I'm dreaming And I realize I must have gone a million miles away And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me at that moment And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say  It's all about soul It's all about knowing what someone is feeling The woman's got soul The power of love and the power of healing This life isn't fair It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold You've got to get tough, but that ain't enough It's all about soul  There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive  It's all about soul It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow It's all about soul Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow You've got to be hard Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n roll But that's only part, you know in your heart It's all about soul  ",
