And in the hard light of an angry sun No one remembers what was said or done Tender are the words they choose You win, I win, we lose  Tender Tender is the night Tender The benediction of the neon light Tender Tender are the hunters Tender is the night When they hold each other tight Tender Tender are the undercover Tender The stranger and the secret lover Tender Tender are the motions Tender is the night When you hold your baby tight  Tender, tender tender...

And how many times can we see love die? And how many times can we give it one more try? Before we really say goodbye Goodbye, goodbye  [Verse 2: Dionne Warwick + Luther Vandross] We're so in love but wrong for each other Each hurt that heals brings on another Both of us used, and  both of us using Hey hey, darling, it's time to stop pretending There's just no way to rewrite our ending We're caught in this game And we know we're both losing  [Chorus: Dionne Warwick + Luther Vandross + both] But how many times can we say goodbye? Hey, how many times can we live a lie? Tell me how many times can we give it one more try? (One more) Before we really say goodbye Goodbye, goodbye  [Bridge: Dionne Warwick + Luther Vandross + both] How many times can we breakup and makeup? Both of our hearts refusing to wake up Just can't go on and on Living a lie, though I'll always love you  [Chorus: Dionne Warwick + Luther Vandross + both] How many times can we say goodbye? And how many times can we live this lie? How many times can we give it one more try? How many time before we really say goodbye Bye-bye, goodbye, bye-bye, goodbye Bye-buh-buh-bye-bye-bye, goodbye, goodbye  ",
