Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here  [Verse 2] Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this And I know you mean only the best And your intentions aren't to bother me But honestly I'd rather be Somewhere with my people We can kick it and just listen to Some music with a message, like we usually do And we'll discuss our big dreams How we plan to take over the planet So pardon my manners I hope you'll understand that I'll be here Not there in the kitchen With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends So tell them I'll be here Right next to the boy who's throwin' up Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more Oh God why am I here?  [Chorus] Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here? Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here  [Bridge] Hours later congregatin' next to the refrigerator Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin' And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low Yo I'll be over here  [Chorus] Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
