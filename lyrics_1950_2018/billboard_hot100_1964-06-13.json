Just sittin' 'round drinkin' with the rest of the guys Six rounds bought and I bought five I spent the groceries and a half the rent I lack fourteen dollars havin' twenty seven cents  Dang me, dang me They oughta take a rope and hang me High from the highest tree Woman would you weep for me?  They say roses are red and violets are purple And sugar's sweet and so is maple syrple Well I'm seventh out of seven sons My pappy was a pistol, I'm a son of a gun  I said dang me, dang me They oughta take a rope and hang me High from the highest tree Woman would you weep for me?
