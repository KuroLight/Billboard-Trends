Oh but I can still remember when I used to gaze out this window Wondering who I was and what I would become And it just took a little while for me to get my head together Growing up's the hardest thing I've ever done Oh but I can still remember...

From your teacher all the way down to your best girlfriend?

Smokin' in the boys' room Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school Checkin' out the halls, makin' sure the coast is clear Lookin' in the stalls, \"No, there ain't nobody here!\" Oh, my buddy Fang, and me and Paul To get caught would surely be the death of us all  Smokin' in the boys' room Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school  All right!  {Instrumental}  Oh, put me to work, in the school book store Check out counter and I got bored Teacher was lookin' for me all around Two hours later, you know where I was found  Smokin' in the boys' room (Yes indeed, I was) Smokin' in the boys' room Now, teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules But everybody knows that smokin' ain't allowed in school  One mo'!
