We've got to hold this piece of ground.\"  I need a volunteer to ride up And bring us back some extra men.\" And Billy's hand was up in a moment Forgetting all the words she said  [Repeat Chorus:]  [Verse 3:] I heard his fiancee got a letter That told how Billy died that day The letter said that he was a hero She should be proud He died that way I heard she threw the letter away  ",

I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!  And the sound of the battle rang Through the streets of the old east side 'Til the last of the hoodlum gang Had surrendered up or died  There was shouting in the street And the sound of running feet And I asked someone who said \"'Bout a hundred cops are dead!\"  I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night it really was Brother what a fight it really was Glory be!  I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!  And there was no sound at all But the clock upon the wall Then the door burst open wide And my daddy stepped inside And he kissed my mama's face And he brushed her tears away  The night Chicago died (Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na) The night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!  The night Chicago died (Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na) The night Chicago died Brother what a night it really was Brother what a fight it really was Glory be!  (The night Chicago died)  ",
