Or will I wake up in confusion just the same?  (Trumpet solo)  And I've run out of pale ale and I feel like I'm in jail Got fleas in the bedroom, got flies in the bathroom Got a call from a good friend, come on down for the weekend Hey Jude, you were alright, I could have grooved with you all night And I've run out of pale ale and I feel like I'm in jail  ",
