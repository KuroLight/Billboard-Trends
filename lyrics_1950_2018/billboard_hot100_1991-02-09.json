All this time the river flowed Endlessly like a silent tear All this time the river flowed Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?  [Bridge] Teachers told the Romans built this place They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town They lived and they died They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left Were the stones the workmen found  [Outro] All this time the river flowed In the falling light of a Northern sun If I had my way, take a boat from the river Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one One by one  ",

        "lyrics": "  [Intro] Talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto Trying to survive, trying to stay alive  [Chorus] The ghetto The ghetto (Talking bout the ghetto) The ghetto The ghetto (Funky, funky ghetto)  [Verse 1: Too $hort] Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth Old school buddies not doing it right Every day it's the same and it's the same every night I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool If he played me close and tried to test my cool Every day I wonder just how I'll die Only thing I know is how to survive There's only one rule in the real world And that's to take care of you, only you and yours Keep dealing with the hard times day after day Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay Black man trying to break into my house again Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen Even though my brothers do me just like that I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto  [Chorus] The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) The ghetto (Funky, funky ghetto) The ghetto (Trying to live our lives) The ghetto (Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)  [Verse 2: Too $hort] So just peep the game and don't call it crap 'Cause to me, life is one hard rap Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed 600 million on a football team And her baby died just like a dope fiend The story I tell is so incomplete Five kids in the house, no food to eat Don't look at me and don't ask me why Mama's next door getting high Even though she's got five mouths to feed She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T I always tell the truth about things like this I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list Instead of adding to the task force send some help Waiting on him I'd better help myself Housing Authority and the O.P.D All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...  [Chorus] The ghetto (People are dyin') The ghetto (Children are cryin') The ghetto (Don't have enough to eat) The ghetto (Don't even have shoes on their feet) The ghetto  [Verse 3: Too $hort] Even though they put us down and call us animals We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes Drive fancy cars, make love to stars Never really saying just who we are We use alias names like TOO $HORT Sell you stuff you might kill for Young kids grow up and that's all they know Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope Only thing he knows is how to survive But will he kill another brother before he dies? In the ghetto, you keep one eye open All day long, just hoping and hoping You can pay your bills and not drink too much Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up Like me, but you don't see Ten years from now, where will you be?  [Chorus] The ghetto (Tryin' to get out of the ghetto) The ghetto (But I got no place to go) The ghetto (Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto) The ghetto (Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)  [Verse 4: Too $hort] So much game in a Too $hort rap Can't be white and whites can't be black Why you wanna act like someone else? All you gotta do is just be yourself We're all the same color underneath Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me Never be ashamed of what you are Proud to be black, stand tall and hard Even though some people give you no respect Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check 'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say So if you don't listen, it's not my fault I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth While me and my people try to get out  [Chorus] The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Funky, funky ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to survive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to stay alive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Funky, funky ghetto) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Got no place else to go) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto) (Tryin' to stay alive) The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)  ",

Seguro que han o\u00eddo que yo soy educado Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado Un joven responsible y siempre bien vestido Yo no se quien ha mentido  I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope My only addiction has to do with the female species I eat 'em raw like sushi  No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno Si me enterno, you me enfermo Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura No me vengan con ternuras  So please don't judge a book by its cover There's more to being a latin lover You got to know how to deal with a woman that won't let go The price you pay for being a gigolo  Rico... Suave...  There's not a woman that can handle A man like me That's why I juggle two or three I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit You pop the question that's it Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres Y la situaci?all?no muere No es un delito calmo mi apetito Con un llanto o un grito  So again don't let my lyrics mislead you I don't love you but I need you Would you rather have me lie Take a piece of your pie and say bye Or be honest and rub your thighs  Rico... Suave...  Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late I never said I was a prompt date But you kept persisting that I meet your parents Huh, they're going to love my appearance  Ding dong el timbre suena Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena Le digo \u00a1Hola! Pero no para bola Que se ha creido vieja chola  Go and serve the food mom Que tengo ambre If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre Y usted se\u00f1or? Why's your chin on the floor? Sierra la boca por favor What's this amor, these little huevos? Esto s?que yo no pruebo I'm used to good ol' fashioned Homestyle Spanish cooking If i try that I'll be puking Well it's been a pleasure but we got to go Regresaremos temprano Cinco, seis, o siete de la ma\u00f1ana Su hija esta en buenas manos  Rico...

The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will to survive  I walked to a cafe where I sat and stared at an empty wall The waitress talked to me, but I could not hear her words at all The only sound that I could hear was the screaming of my soul My world revolved around one single thing I wish to know  Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will to survive  The weather was changing, snow began falling The sky became dark like the mood of my heart I watched all the lovers Sharing together, their smiles and laughter were painful reminders I seem to recapture the moment I held her I made her swear that she'd always be there But she left me sorrow and fear of tomorrow As soon as I wake there's a pain I can't shake in my heart  Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will Does she love that man? The way that I'm loving her still Does she love that man? For she has broken my will Does she love him? Does she love him? Does she love that man?  ",
