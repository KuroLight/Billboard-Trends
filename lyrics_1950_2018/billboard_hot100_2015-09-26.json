My - my step brother used to flip them bags Outside the crib like it was trash day No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye) But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance Used to look up at the stars And be like, \"Ain't too much that's different\" I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?  [Hook: Kanye West] And I hope you learn to make it on your own And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams And when you get it all, just remember one thing Remember one thing, one man could change the world One man could change the world  [Verse 2: Big Sean] My grandma told me, \"If you write your name in stone You'll never get the white out\" I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks Where I'm from, I swear they broke They need way more than the cast We need more than what you have And then we need more than that But how am I supposed to say I'm tired If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions That I couldn't survive? Went to war, came back alive On top of that became a female black captain When being black, you had to extra-extra try Way before James Brown made us proud She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...  [Hook: John Legend] I hope you learn to make it on your own And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams And when you get it all, just remember one thing Remember one thing, that one man can change the world That one man can change the world  [Outro: Grandma & Big Sean] Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you It's all good, I love you grandma Bye  ",
