[Verse 1] Rolling through the hood Just stopped by to say what's up And let you know That your baby boy ain't doing so tough And even though you passed Going on four long years Still waking up late at night crying tears Just thinking about those days You used to talk to me Smiling while I'm sipping on this Hennessy And remember we bragged on how rich we would be To get up out this hood was like a fantasy  [Pre-Chorus] And now you hear my songs the radio is playing Oh I can't believe my ears And what everybody's saying And boy I'll tell you Folks don't know the half I would give it all up Just to take one ride (With you) How I used to kick it on the front porch (With you) And how I used to lay back and smoke weed (With you) And all the little basement party joints we'd do Now I'm just missing you How I wish  [Chorus] I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're smiling down on me Saying everything's okay And if I make it out this thug life I'll see you again someday I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish  [Verse 2] Now ever since this money come It's been nothing but stress Sometimes I wish I could just trade in my success Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton That's why you hear me shooting this real shit off like a gun Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits And fake ass players get a real player hating 'em \"Honey Love\" goes platinum and y'all ass come around But y'all don't wanna raise the roof Until my shit is going down  [Pre-Chorus] And now you hear my songs the radio is playing Oh I can't believe my ears And what everybody's saying And boy I'll tell you Folks don't know the half I would give it all up Just to take one ride (With you) How I used to hoop off in them tournaments (With you) And how I used to club hop on weekends (With you) Your family called the morning of a tragic end Damn, my condolences  [Chorus] I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're smiling down on me Saying everything's okay And if I make it out this thug life I'll see you again someday I wish, I wish, I wish I wish, I wish, I wish  [Verse 3] Voices in my head be telling me to come to church Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse When waking up to life sometimes seems worse And all I ever wanted is to be a better man And I try to keep it real with my homies land For me to save the world I don't understand How did I become the leader of a billion fans?  [Pre-Chorus] And now you hear my songs the radio is playing Oh I can't believe my ears And what everybody's saying And boy I'll tell you Folks don't know the half I would give it all up Just to take one ride (With you) How I used to street perform on Friday (With you) And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday (With you) Instead of you all throwing them stones at me Somebody pray for me  [Chorus: Choir] I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're smiling down on me Saying everything's okay  I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're smiling down on me Saying everything's okay  I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face I know you're smiling down on me Saying everything's okay  I wish that I could hold you now I wish that I could touch you now I wish that I could talk to you Be with you somehow I know you're in a better place Even though I can't see your face  ",

[Verse 1: Ludacris] I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50-yard line While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree And if you like in the club, we can do it In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop Or how about on the beach with black sand? Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man Table top or just give me a lap dance The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom Or in back of the classroom How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon See I cast 'em and I passed 'em Get a tight grip and I grasp 'em I flash 'em and outlast 'em And if ain't good then I trash 'em While you stash 'em, I'll let 'em free And they tell me what they fantasy Like up on the roof, roof Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

A red carpet dick it just roll out Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out We can do it in the pouring rain Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out How about in the library on top of books? But you can't be too loud! You wanna make a brother beg for it Give me TLC 'cause you know I be too proud We can do it in the White House Try to make them turn the lights out Champagne with my campaign Let me do the damn thing What's my name, what's my name, what's my name? A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie You can scratch my back and rule me You can push me and just pull me On hay in middle of the barn Rose petals on the silk sheets Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet  [Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna] I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo' Then I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

On the ocean or in the boat! Factories or one hundred spokes! What about up in the candy store? That chocolate, chocolate make it melt Whips and chains, handcuffs Smack a little booty up with my belt Scream \"help!\" Play my game! Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs Horseback and I'll get my reins School teacher, let me get my brains  [Chorus: Ludacris & Shawna] I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes And I wanna, move from the bed down to the, down to the, to the flo' Then I wanna, \"Ahh ahh,\" you make it so good I don't wanna leave But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know, what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

How's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan  [Hook: Dido] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)] Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert You didn't have to But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old We waited in the blisterin' cold For you, for four hours, and you just said no That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on \u2018Cause I don't really got shit else So that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See, everything you say is real, and I respect you \u2018cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous \u2018cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me, man I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together too  [Hook: Dido] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)] Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans This'll be the last package I ever send your ass It's been six months, and still no word \u2014 I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air of the Night\" About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin' Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together \u2014 think about it! You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep And you scream about it; I hope your conscience eats at you And you can't breathe without me See, Slim\u2014 shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you \u2018Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!  [Hook: Dido] My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 4: Eminem] Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph For your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' Off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand That I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news A couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was\u2026 it was you, damn  ",
