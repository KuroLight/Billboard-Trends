I'm nearly great but there's something missing I left it in the duty free Oh, though you never really belonged to me  You're not the only one staring at the sun Afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside I'm not sucking my thumb, staring at the sun Not the only one who's happy to go blind  ",
