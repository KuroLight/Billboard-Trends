We walk blind and we try to see Falling behind in what could be  Bring me a higher love Bring me a higher love, oh Bring me a higher love Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?  Worlds are turning, and we're just hanging on Facing our fear and standing out there alone A yearning and it's real to me There must be someone who's feeling for me  {Hook}  Things look so bad everywhere In this whole world, what is fair? We walk blind and we try to see Falling behind in what could be  Bring me a higher love Bring me a higher love, oh Bring me a higher love Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?  Bring me a higher love Bring me a higher love, oh Bring me a higher love A good kind of love, want a higher love  I will wait for it I'm not too late for it Until then, I'll sing my song To cheer the night along  Bring it, oh  {Bridge}  I could light the night up with my soul on fire I could make the sun shine from pure desire Let me feel that love come over me Let me feel how strong it could be  Oh  {Bridge }  Bring me a higher love Bring me a higher love, oh Bring me a higher love Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

You try to get up and here it comes again  Right down to the basics of it Right down to the wire  So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack  Hold on Come back Oh yeah, it's just that easy So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack  Hold on Come back Oh yeah, it's just that easy  Ring the bell Ring the bell Let the walls come down  Surrender your wings before they lift you off the ground  Surrender for every reason Surrender yourself  Sometimes you go so far You're so hot You can't stop Can you make it last Make it rock to the bone? If you do it faster will the hunger drive you home? Right down to the basics of it Right down to the wire So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack  Can you ride the rhythm of this human wave? So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack So if you feel you're hanging on a heart attack  ",

Do you think of that someone When you hear that special melody?  I always stop and think of you especially When the words of a love song Touch the very heart of me  There'll be sad songs to make you cry Love songs often do They can touch the heart of someone new Saying I love you  I often wonder how it could be you loving me Two hearts in perfect harmony I'll count the hours until that day A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me  Until the moment that you give your love to me You're the one I care for The one that I would wait for  There'll be sad songs to make you cry Love songs often do They can touch the heart of someone new Saying I love you  There'll be sad songs to make you cry Love songs often do They can touch the heart of someone new Saying I love you  Oh, mmm, oh You're my desire, you take me higher My love is like a river running so deep  I always stop and think of you especially When the words of a love song Touch the very heart of me  There'll be sad songs to make you cry Love songs often do They can touch the heart of someone new Saying I love you, oh  There'll be sad songs to make you cry Love songs often do They can touch the heart of someone new Saying I love you  Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo Oooh, saying I love you I love you  ",
