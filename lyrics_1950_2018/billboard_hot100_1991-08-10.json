But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman [?] superior to handle any male Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show And if you ask my producers, they'll reply \u201cNo\u2026\u201d  [Hook: Ice Cube] \u201cYou can't play with my Yo-Yo!\u201d (Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)  [Verse 1] My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt To the fact I hit the 8-ball often The earrings I wear are called Dolphins Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother) I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?

Yep, I put lipstick on his collar At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?! But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo) I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

You lack skills to be a woman that's black Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?! Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya Because the world ain't a big soap opera It only takes one punch to drop ya And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya But no, I'm not living like that verse Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right) But no, it's not to cause corruptions Just to fight back on destruction Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

For all y'all suckas Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it You can't play wit my Yo-Yo  [Verse 4] I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, \"More, more!\" I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior Should we dare to take the stand And diss back all the men Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling? I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet If we wanna live with justice and harmony How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)  ",
