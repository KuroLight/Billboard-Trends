Can't you feel them swimming around? You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only bait in town Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh-woah You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only girl in town  She's saving up all of her money Wants to hit it south in May Maybe roll in the sand with a rock 'n roll man Somewhere down Monserat Way But the money's good, and the season Helps to lighten up her load Boys keep her high as the months go by She's getting post cards from the road  Can't you feel them closing in, honey? Can't you feel them schooling around? You got fins to the left, fins to the right And you're the only girl in town  Sailed off to Antigua It took her three days on a boat Looking for some peace and quiet Maybe keep her dreams afloat But now she feels like A remora With the school still close at hand Just behind the reef are the big white teeth Of the sharks that can swim on the land  Can't you feel them circling, honey?

Well who says I need a doctor 'Cause I'm a second-hand crazed I've been laughing so much  Oh they want to put me away And I'm really gonna take these chains Of off my life 'cause this lightening I know I would never ever strike twice  ",

He was willing to make a deal When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said \"Boy, let me tell you what.\"  \"I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.\"  The boy said, \"My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.\"  Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose the devil gets your soul  The Devil opened up his case and he said, \"I'll start this show.\" And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:  [Demonic violin piece]  When the Devil finished, Johnny said, \"Well, you're pretty good ol' son But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.\"  \"Fire on the Mountain.\" Run, boys, run! The Devil's in the house of the rising sun; Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no  [Non-demonic violin piece]  The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said, \"Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.\" And he played:  \"Fire on the Mountain.\" Run, boys, run! The Devil's in the house of the rising sun; Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no  ",
