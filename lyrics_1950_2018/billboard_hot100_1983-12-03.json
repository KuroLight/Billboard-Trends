There was a time before we were born If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be  [Chorus] Hi-yeah, we drift in and out Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth Out of all those kinds of people You got a face with a view I'm just an animal looking for a home Share the same space for a minute or two And you love me 'til my heart stops Love me 'til I'm dead Eyes that light up, eyes look through you Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, ah-ooh  ",
