Just hold on tight and be strong I know I'll make it through Nows the time for the needs to finally go away I feel you near, and it's a lovely day  [Chorus: S.O.U.L.

(\"Get nothin' but abuse...\")  [Verse 1 \u2013 Sadat X] One day when I was ridin' on the train I seen these two kids talkin' About the Nubian reign had fallen I didn't say nothin' cuz these kids caught my goat Even wore my coat like a murder that they wrote So this kid with mouth swagger 'n I'll blaze the cloak and dagger So I gotta show Dukes the macho lot that I am I can rock a jam, make the world drop ham Oh yes, I'm the bad man, and bad men wear black And if it comes to droppin' bombs, yo, I'm with that Though I can freak, fly, flow, fuck up a faggot Don't understand their ways I ain't down with gays You wanna grab the style that was made from my mom and my dad When I was young I used to run with a notepad Then time flew and somehow I knew that I was bad to the bone... Black prodigy since the age of twen-ty I could write a rhyme, rip it up and write a next one Right on the spot, sign my name with a dot Diamond D threw me some smooth shit, Bronx crowd roar Stick up your wack jam, everybody hit the floor Okay it's you, Slim, the hard rock of the pack Don't wanna kneel to the brothers, you must be holin' Bust some shit in his chest, now his whole body's swollen Why did I have to do it? He asked for it His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be....check it out now I ain't goin' out, man that short shit is dead Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread He got a cannon that's bad...similar to the one that I got from my own dad  Refrain 4x  [Verse 2 \u2013 Lord Jamar] Your punk ass'll be grass quick fast like my name was Flash When a nigga try and rob me for my cash You thought you had a sweet vic, a nice pick But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick Now who's the trick, cuz I'm not a ho. (No, no-no-no!) I always do the fuckin', just might do the buckin' I leave my Nikes stuck in your rectum, till you learn Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em Dissect 'em, yo, our word is bond regardless To my what, and do the Puma strut So step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face With the mothafuckin' bass! Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth, it's gonna flood south To the ground, and you're gonna know I don't fuck around So if you think you had two soft newjacks We're gonna have top off you with a few cracks To the jaw and you won't pop that shit no more Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor Did you want some more? I didn't think so Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire Lord Jamar will live long, cuz I give strong blows the heads of my foes Dread flows, gives me power as it grows Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot Heed not, and hell will be your home Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your dome  Refrain 4x  ",
