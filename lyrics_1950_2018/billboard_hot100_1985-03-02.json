Please stay, and...  [Chorus] I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool I should have known better than to cheat a friend And waste a chance that I'd been given So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you  [Outro] Now that you're gone, now that you're gone Now that you're gone, was what I did so wrong, so wrong That you had to leave me alone?
