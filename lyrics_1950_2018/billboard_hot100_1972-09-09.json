I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  [Bridge 1] It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?  [Classical guitar solo]  Alone again, naturally  [Verse 3] Now looking back over the years And what ever else that appears I remember I cried when my father died Never wishing to hide the tears  And at sixty-five years old My mother, God rest her soul Couldn't understand, why the only man She had ever loved had been taken  Leaving her to start with a heart So badly broken Despite encouragement from me No words were ever spoken  And when she passed away I cried and cried all day Alone again, naturally Alone again, naturally  ",
