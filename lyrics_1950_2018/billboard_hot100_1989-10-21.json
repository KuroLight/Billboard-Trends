I thought you knew it when I said That I would call last night I couldn't find myself a phone Now come to think about it Can you tell me, am I right? How do I know you were alone?  (These boots are made for walking) (That's just what they'll do) (One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)  (Ah ah aaah ah) (Ah ah aaah ah ah)  Don't try to tell me I'm the one who's making our mistakes And that I'm causing all the pain I told you once before you gotta learn some give and take Or was my talking all in vain  Oh there may come a day when I can give my soul about Right now I need my space and time I'll give you everything one day you know I will somehow I'm gonna hold on to my pride  (These boots are made for walking) (That's just what they'll do) (One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)  I see you want me to walk You see there's no room for talk Standing out in the cold You got me feinin' and gawking A fool is what I'm feeling But see baby that's fine I bought some blue suede shoes this time To do some stepping And do some stomping Hanging out with the guys and the girls, do some romping Dance and play and shout and everything's cool You put a boot in your mouth fool  (These boots are made for walking) (That's just what they'll do) (One of these days this boots are gonna walk all over you)  (Are you ready boots?)
