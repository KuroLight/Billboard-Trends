Only time will tell Just how well I'll get to know you Don't mean to lead you on But I want to take it slowly, slowly  Don't rush me I've made that mistake before, ah Don't rush me This love could be so much more It's well worth the waiting for Desire can mean danger I wanna lover, not another stranger I'm saving all my passion Who's to say if its love, or just attraction? Only time will tell Just how well I'll get to know you Don't mean to lead you on, But I want to take it slowly, slowly  And my resistance is weakening,weakening everytime we touch Baby, you get everything, everything that I've been dreamin' of  Don't rush me I've made that mistake before, oh yeah Don't rush me. This love could be so much more It's well worth the waiting for, yeah My resistance is weakening Every time we touch Cause baby you've got everything Everything That I've been dreaming of  (guitar solo)  Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more It's well worth the waiting for Don't rush me. I've made that mistake before Oh yeah. Don't rush me. This love could be so much more It's well worth the waiting for, yeah  ",

Forever, and ever Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever young  [Verse 4] Some are like water, some are like the heat Some are a melody and some are the beat Sooner or later they all will be gone Why don't they stay young  [Verse 5] It's so hard to get old without a cause I don't want to perish like a fading horse Youth's like diamonds in the sun And diamonds are forever  [Verse 6] So many adventures couldn't happen today So many songs we forgot to play So many dreams swinging out of the blue We let them come true  [Chorus] Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever?
