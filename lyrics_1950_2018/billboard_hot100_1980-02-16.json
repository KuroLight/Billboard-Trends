We had something to learn Now it's time for the wheel to turn Grains of sand, one by one Before you know, it's all gone  Let's admit we made a mistake But can we still be friends? Heartbreak's never easy to take But can we still be friends?  It's a strange sad affair Sometimes seems that we just don't care Don't waste time feeling hurt We've been through hell together  Dannana etc Can we still be friends Can we still get together sometimes? Hey babe, can we still go on and on and on?  We awoke from our dream Things are not always what they seem Memories linger on It's like a sweet, sad, old song  Dannana etc, Can we still be friends  ",
