I truly am indeed Alone again, naturally  [Bridge 1] It seems to me that There are more hearts Broken in the world That can't be mended Left unattended What do we do? What do we do?

And remember what comfort there may be In owning a piece thereof. Avoid quiet and passive persons Unless you are in need of sleep. Rotate your tires.  Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself And heed well their advice, Even though they be turkeys. Know what to kiss... and when!  Consider that two wrongs never make a right But that three... do. Wherever possible, put people on hold. Be comforted that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment And despite the changing fortunes of time, There is always a big future in computer maintenance.  [Chorus] You are a fluke Of the universe. You have no right to be here. And whether you can hear it or not The universe is laughing behind your back.  Remember the Pueblo. Strive at all times to bend, fold, spindle and mutilate. Know yourself. If you need help, call the FBI. Exercise caution in your daily affairs, Especially with those persons closest to you. That lemon on your left, for instance.  Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls Would scarcely get your feet wet. Fall not in love therefore; It will stick to your face. Gracefully surrender the things of youth: The birds, clean air, tuna, Taiwan And let not the sands of time Get in your lunch.  Hire people with hooks. For a good time call 606-4311; Ask for \"Ken.\" Take heart amid the deepening gloom That your dog is finally getting enough cheese. And reflect that whatever misfortune may be your lot It could only be worse in Milwaukee.  [Chorus]  Therefore, make peace with your god Whatever you conceive him to be- Hairy thunderer, or cosmic muffin. With all its hopes, dreams, promises and urban renewal The world continues to deteriorate. GIVE UP!  [Chorus]  ",
