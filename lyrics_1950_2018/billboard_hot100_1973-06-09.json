Invest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you The ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play  Take the prize for instant pleasure Captain of the cricket team Public speaking in all weathers A knighthood from a queen  Best Friends All of your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand There's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran Climb in your old umbrella Does it have a nasty tear in the dome?  But the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone  Critique Oblique Lover of the black and white it's your first night The Passion Play, goes all the way, spoils your insight Tell me how the baby's made, how the lady's laid Why the old dog howls in sadness  And your little sister's immaculate virginity wings away On the bony shoulders of a young horse named George Who stole surreptitiously into her geography revision (The examining body examined her body.)  Actor of the low-high Q, let's hear your view Peek at the lines upon your sleeves since your memory won't do Tell me: how the baby's graded, how the lady's faded Why the old dogs howl with madness  All of this and some of that's the only way to skin the cat And now you've lost a skin or two, you're for us and we for you The dressing room is right behind We've got you taped, you're in the play How does it feel to be in the play? How does it feel to play the play? How does it feel to be the play?  Man of passion rise again, we won't cross you out: For we do love you like a son, of that there's no doubt Tell us: is it you who are here for our good cheer? Or are we here for the glory, for the story, for the gory satisfaction Of telling you how absolutely awful you really are?  There was a rush along the Fulham Road There was a hush in the Passion Play  Forest Dance No.1 Instrumental part  ",

[Verse 1:] Thirty some odd years ago A young man came to Memphis Asking about a rose That used to blossom in his world  People never took the time To mind the young man`s questions Until one day They heard him ask a little green eyed girl  [Chorus:] What`s your mama's name, child? What`s your mama's name? Does she ever talk About a place called New Orleans?  Has she ever mentioned A man named Buford Wilson? What`s your mama`s name, child? What`s your mama`s name?  [Verse 2:] Twenty some odd years ago A drunk down in Memphis Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail  Just because he asked A little green eyed girl a question And offered her a nickel`s worth of candy If she`d tell  A year and some odd days ago An old man died in Memphis Just another wayward soul the county had to claim  Inside the old man`s ragged coat They found a faded letter It said you have a daughter And her eyes are Wilson green  [Chorus:] What`s your mama's name, child? What`s your mama's name? Does she ever talk About a place called New Orleans? Has she ever mentioned A man named Buford Wilson?  What`s your mama's name, child? What`s your mama's name? What`s your mama's name, child? What`s your mama's name?  ",
