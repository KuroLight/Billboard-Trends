Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye It goes running through your soul Like the stories told of old  Old man, he and his dog They walk the old land Every flower touched his cold hand As he slowly walked by Weeping willows would cry for joy, joy  Feels so good Feels so good, it's frightening Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da la da da da........  Mysteries like this and Many others in the trees Blow in the night in the Southern skies  Southern nights They feel so good, it's frightening Wish I could stop this world from fighting La da da da da........  Southern skies Have you ever noticed...  ",
