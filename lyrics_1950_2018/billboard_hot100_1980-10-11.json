You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.\"  [Chorus 1] Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the car I'm driving? \"Can't you tell that it's out of style?\" Should I get a set of white wall tires? \"Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile? Nowadays you can't be too sentimental Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.\"  Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk It's still rock and roll to me  Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers Cause it's always been the same old scene There's a new band in town But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine... Aimed at your average teen  How about a pair of pink sidewinders And a bright orange pair of pants? \"You could really be a Beau Brummel baby If you just give it half a chance Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.\"  [Chorus 3] Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways It's still rock and roll to me  What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? \"Don't you know that they're out of touch?\" Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? \"If you are then you think too much Don't you know about the new fashion honey? All you need are looks and a whole lotta money.\"  [Chorus 1] Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me  ",
