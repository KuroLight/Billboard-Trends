Don't let it slip from view  The horizon's awaiting Your river is fading  So keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on But for tonight Just keep the fire burning bright  I will never need to ask What have I done? Comes a moment when it's clear There's only one Oh, whatever you need of me I've made up my mind I give you more than you've asked for  There are those who can foresee Where we will go All the future I don't really want to know Only that you'll be here with me  While the embers still glow We'll be safe till tomorrow  Keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on For tonight Just keep the fire burning bright  Keep the fire burning tonight See just what comes into sight Don't take forever Take it through the night And believe the sun Will rise with the dawn That's all you need to go on For tonight Just keep the fire burning  (Keep the fire bright) Who are you?

Did you stand by me? No, not at all  Now I got a job, but it don't pay I need new clothes, I need somewhere to stay But without all these things I can do But without your love, I won't make it through But you don't understand my point of view I suppose there's nothing I can do  (Chorus) You didn't stand by me No, not at all You didn't stand by me No way   You must explain Why this must be Did you lie When you spoke to me?

I guess it has something to do with the way That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans  Ohhhhhh........ (Come on, where's all the kickers in here?!)

I'm wondering where the lions are...  Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take Pointing a finger at eternity I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy  Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun (should be!) they got me thinking about eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me And I'm wondering where the lions are... I'm wondering where the lions are...  Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay One of these days we're going to sail away Going to sail into eternity Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me And I'm wondering where the lions are...
