There's an old voice in my head That's holding me back Well tell her that I miss our little talks  Soon it will all be over and buried with our past We used to play outside when we were young And full of life and full of love  Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear  Cause though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  [Chorus] Hey! Don't listen to a word I say Hey! The screams all sound the same Hey!  Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  You're gone, gone, gone away I watched you disappear All that's left is a ghost of you Now we're torn, torn, torn apart There's nothing we can do Just let me go, we'll meet again soon  Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around I'll see you when I fall asleep  Hey! Don't listen to a word I say Hey! The screams all sound the same Hey!  Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  Hey! Don't listen to a word I say Hey! The screams all sound the same Hey!  Though the truth may vary This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore  ",
