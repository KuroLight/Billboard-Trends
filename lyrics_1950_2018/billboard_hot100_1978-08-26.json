[Verse 1: Roger Daltrey] I woke up in a Soho doorway A policeman knew my name He said \"You can go sleep at home tonight If you can get up and walk away\" I staggered back to the underground And the breeze blew back my hair I remember throwing punches around And preaching from my chair  [Chorus 2: The Who] Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)  [Verse 2: Roger Daltrey] I took the tube back out of town Back to the Rolling Pin I felt a little like a dying clown With a streak of Rin Tin Tin I stretched back and I hiccupped And looked back on my busy day Eleven hours in the Tin Pan God, there's got to be another way Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa  [Chorus 3: The Who] Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you?

[Outro: The Who] Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Tell me whoa are you(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?) Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
