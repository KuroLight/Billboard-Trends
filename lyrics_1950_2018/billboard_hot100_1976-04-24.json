I'm Mandy, fly me  I've often heard her jingle It's never struck a chord With a smile as bright as sunshine She called me through the poster And welcomed me aboard  She led me she fed me She read me like a book But I'm hiding in the small print Won't you take another look? And take me away Try me, Mandy, fly me away  The world was spinning like a ball And then it wasn't there at all And as my heart began to fall  [Instrumental/Bridge]  I saw her walking on the water As the sharks were comin' for me I felt Mandy pull me up, give me the kiss of life Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No Oh, when they pulled me from the wreckage And her body couldn't be found Was it in my mind it seems I had a crazy dream I told them so but they said no no no no  I found me on a street And starin' at a wall If it hadn't have been for Mandy Her promise up above me Well I wouldn't be here at all So if you're travellin' in the sky Don't be surprised if someone says Hi I'm Mandy, fly me  ",
