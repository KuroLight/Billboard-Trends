Giving up on the innocence you left behind  [Verse 2] Some claim to have the fortitude Too shrewd to blow the interlude Sustaining pain to set the mood Step out to be renewed I'll move you like a baritone Jungle brother's on the microphone Getting over with the undertone It's time to turn to stone Chitty chitty baby When your nose is in the nitty gritty Life can be a little sweet But life can be a little shitty What a pity Boston and a Kansas City Looking for a hundred But you only ever found a fifty Three fingers in the honeycomb You ring just like a xylophone Devoted to the chromosome The day that you left home  [Chorus] Tell me baby What's your story? Where you come from And where you want to go this time, oh Tell me lover Are you lonely? The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh Tell me baby What's your story Where you come from And where you want to go this time, oh You're so lovely Are you lonely?

[Chorus] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda] Mike, he doesn't need his name up in lights He just wants to be heard, whether it's the beat or the mic He feels so unlike everybody else, alone In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him  But fuck 'em, he knows the code, it's not about the salary It's all about reality and making some noise Making a story, making sure his clique stays up That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin' it up, let's go  [Verse 2: Tak] Who the hell is he, anyway? He never really talks much Never concerned with status but still leaving 'em star-struck Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a living from writing raps  Put it together himself, now the picture connects Never asking for someone's help, or to get some respect He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist  [Verse 3: Ryu] This is twenty percent skill, eighty percent beer Be a hundred percent clear, 'cause Ryu is ill Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method \"Name of the Game\"  Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church I like \"Bleach\", man, Ryu had the stupidest verse This dude is the truth, now, everybody givin' him guest spots His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot  [Chorus] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  [Verse 4: Ryu] They call him Ryu the Sick, and he's spittin' fire with Mike Got him out the dryer, he's hot, found him in Fort Minor with Tak What a fucking nihilist, porcupine--he's a prick, he's a cock The type woman want to be with and rappers hope he get shot  Eight years in the making, patiently waiting to blow Now, the record with Shinoda's taking over the globe He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat  [Verse 5: Tak] Tak, he's not your everyday on the block He knows how to work with what he's got Making his way to the top He often gets a comment on his name, people keep asking him \"Was it given at birth or does it stand for an acronym?\"  No, he's living proof, got him rocking the booth He'll get you buzzing quicker than a shot of vodka with juice Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they doing, give a hundred percent  [Verse 6: Mike Shinoda] Forget Mike, nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind  It's like a design is written in his head, every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed? Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?  [Chorus] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name  [Outro: Mike] Yeah!
