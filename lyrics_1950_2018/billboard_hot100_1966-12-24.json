How do you catch a girl? Won't somebody tell me please? How do you catch a girl?  Daniel Boone took a rifle and a coonskin cap And he found an icy river and he set a little trap And he took a bit of jerky and he took a little nap And he knew he'd catch a beaver or a fat muskrat  But how do you catch a girl? How do you catch a girl? Won't somebody tell me please? How do you catch a girl?  I'd like to know how to catch a girl I've caught frogs, I've caught snakes, earthworms And they may be nice But girls, oh  Well, I asked the local lover and he told me what to do He said learn the rocking dances both old and new But it's hard to do those dances with two left feet So I've got to find a method that'll work for me  Oh, how do you catch a girl? How do you catch a girl? Won't somebody tell me please? How do you catch a girl?  I wish I knew How do you catch a girl? How do you catch a girl? How do you catch a girl? How do you catch a girl?
