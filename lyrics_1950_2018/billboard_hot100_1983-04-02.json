You don't do the things that I do You wanna do things I can't do Always something breaking us in two  You and I could never live alone But don't you feel like breaking out just one day on your own? Why does what I'm saying hurt you? I didn't say that we were through Always something breaking us in two  They say two hearts should beat as one for us We'll fight it out to see it through I say that won't be too much fun for us Though it's oh so nice to get advice It's oh so hard to do  Could we be much closer if we tried? We could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes Maybe we could last an hour Maybe then we'd see right through Always something breaking us in two  Always something breaking us in two  ",

And who was right? It didn't matter in the thick of the fight  We held the day in the palm of our hand They ruled the night, and the night Seemed to last as long as six weeks On Parris Island We held the coastline, they held the highlands  And they were sharp, as sharp as knives They heard the hum of our motors They counted the rotors And waited for us to arrive  [Chorus] And we would all go down together We said we'd all go down together Yes we would all go down together  ",

And we can break through Though torn in two We can be one  [Chorus 2] I...I will begin again I...I will begin again  [Bridge] Oh... Maybe the time is right Oh...maybe tonight...

It was a cool and lonely breezy afternoon (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) You could feel it cause it was the month of June (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) So I left my gate and went out for a walk (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say (How does it feel when you've got no food ?)  Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance (Jah know!)  (scatting)  So I stopped to find out what was going on (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing (How does it feel when you've got no food ?) You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say (How does it feel when you've got no food ?)  Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance (Jah know!)  Cause me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass Give me little music make me wind up me waist Me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass Give me little music make me wind up me waist, I say  Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance (Jah know!)  You play it on the radio And so me say, we a go hear it on the stereo And so me know you a go play it on the disco And so me say we a go hear it on the stereo  Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side Pass the Dutchie 'pon the left hand side It a go bun, give me music, make me jump and prance It a go dung, give me the music, make me rockin' at the dance (Jah know!)
