Just because you've seen my face, just because you know my name I'm a stranger in this town Can't I have my ups and downs? Can't you see that I'm human?  I get hungry, get thirsty I get moody, I need attention I need your love I need your love I want your love  Give me just another night, just another night with you 'Cause I'm freezing in this hundred-dollar hotel room Don't make me leave you.
