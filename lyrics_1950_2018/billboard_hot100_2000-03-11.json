As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there I respect your mom's tutelage But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this? Watch and learn, foolish kid Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am Look, same pedigree, theoretically Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically One job in life to make you a much better me Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it My hands were in bondage, useless Beyond the excuses, calm through it It\u2019s crazy, our bond music And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit So right now I stand in a place I never stood before Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for Now it's better than we pictured it'd be And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it Little nigga we'll be  [Interlude] This is greater than us.

(Dada?)  [Hook: Eminem] Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  [Verse 3: Dr. Dre] If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me, with your hands out, looking up to me Like you want somethin' free When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me But now that I got this little company Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease But you won't get a crumb from me \u2018Cause I'm from the streets of Compton I told 'em all, all them little gangstas Who you think helped mold 'em all? Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns Like I ain't got none; what, you think I sold 'em all \u2018Cause I stay well off? Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off What, \u2018cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad Tryin' to get this damn label off? I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath It ain't gonna be nothin' after that So give me one more platinum plaque And fuck rap, you can have it back So where's all the Mad Rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch  [Hook: Eminem] Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays, everybody wanna talk Like they got somethin' to say But nothin' comes out when they move their lips Just a bunch of gibberish And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre  ",

Yes, a spectacle monopolized They hold the reins, stole your eyes All the Fist-a-gons, the bullets, and bombs Who stuff the banks, who staff the party ranks More for Gore or the son of a drug lord None of the above. Fuck it, cut the cord!  [Chorus] Lights out! Guerrilla radio! Turn that shit up! Lights out! Guerrilla radio! Turn that shit up! Lights out! Guerrilla radio! Turn that shit up! Lights out! Guerrilla radio!  [Verse 3] Contact, I hijacked the frequencies Blockin' the beltway, move on DC! Way past the days of bombin' MCs' Sound off, Mumia go on be free! Who got 'em? Yo, check the federal file All you pendejos know the trial was vile An army of pigs try to silence my style Off 'em all out that box, it's my radio dial!  [Chorus] Lights out! Guerrilla radio!

It's not what I perfer So, it's either here just drinking beer or at home remembering her  [Chorus] Pop a top, again I think I'll have another round Set em' up my friend Then I'll be gone and you can let some other fool sit down Pop a top, again  ",
