I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!  And the sound of the battle rang Through the streets of the old east side 'Til the last of the hoodlum gang Had surrendered up or died  There was shouting in the street And the sound of running feet And I asked someone who said \"'Bout a hundred cops are dead!\"  I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night it really was Brother what a fight it really was Glory be!  I heard my mama cry I heard her pray the night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!  And there was no sound at all But the clock upon the wall Then the door burst open wide And my daddy stepped inside And he kissed my mama's face And he brushed her tears away  The night Chicago died (Na-na na, na-na-na, na-na-na) The night Chicago died Brother what a night the people saw Brother what a fight the people saw Yes indeed!

I just had my truck washed\" She allowed as how that sounded like a whole lotta fun But we was gonna have to wait until the dishes was done And was it alright with me if she brought along her mother as a chaperone? I said, \"Why not?\"  Well, we geared that tranny into super low And the four of us went to see a picture show Yeah, took 'em to the drive-in theater over by Pisgah to see True Grit Saw the late late show Old Sloan hit the sack And then along about two o'clock I hauled 'em on back To the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe  Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe (Eight stools and a promise)  Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Oh, the Old Home Filler-Up An' Keep On A-Truckin' Cafe (They got a real nice place there)  ",

Didn't know what happened But I knew it beat the hell out of sniffin' burlap  I come to and my brother was there And he said, \"What's wrong with your eyes?\" I said, \"I don't know, I was chewing on a weed\" He said, \"Let me give it a try\" We spent the rest of that day and most of that night Trying to find my brother, Bill Caught up with him, 'bout six o'clock the next morning Naked, singing on the wind mill! He said he flew up there I had to fly up there and bring him down He was about half crazy  The very next day we picked a bunch of them weeds And put 'em in the sun to dry Then we mashed 'em up and chopped 'em up And put 'em in the corncob pipe Smokin' that wildwood flower got to be a habit We didn't see no harm We thought it was kind of handy Take a trip and never leave the farm! Big 'ole puff of that wildwood weed next thing you know You're just wand'ring 'round behind the little animals  All good things gotta come to an end And it's the same with the wildwood weed One day this feller from Washington came by And he spied it and turned white as a sheet Then they dug and they burned And they burned and they dug And they killed all our cute little weeds Then they drove away We just smiled and waved Sittin' there on that sack of seeds!  \"Y'all come back now, ya hear?\"  ",
