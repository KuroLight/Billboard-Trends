I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.\" She said  [Refrain] What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone on the bedroom floor Cause he's hungry And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money And his daddy's gone Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown I ain't got a job now So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life  [Verse 2] Girl you ain't the only one with a baby That's no excuse to be living all crazy Then she looked me right square in the eye And said every day I wake up hopin' to die She said-nigga I know about pain cause Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us Before I was a teenager I been through more shit that you can't even relate to  [Refrain] What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone on the bedroom floor Cause he's hungry And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money And his daddy's gone Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown I ain't got a job now So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life  Yo way hold up, hold up, hold up Hold up, stop the breakin' yo Stop the breakin' You should you ain't gonna be going out Like this men  [Bridge] Hold up!
