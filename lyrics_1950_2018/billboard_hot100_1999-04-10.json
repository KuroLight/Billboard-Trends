The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; or never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you\u2019ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can\u2019t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine  Don\u2019t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing Bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that Never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some idle Tuesday  Do one thing every day that scares you  Sing  Don\u2019t be reckless with other people\u2019s hearts; don\u2019t put up with people who are reckless with yours  Floss  Don\u2019t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you\u2019re ahead, sometimes you\u2019re behind. The race is long, and in the end, it\u2019s only with yourself  Remember the compliments you receive; forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements  Stretch  Don\u2019t feel guilty if you don\u2019t know what you want to do with your Life. The most interesting people I know didn\u2019t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don\u2019t  Get plenty of calcium  Be kind to your knees, you\u2019ll miss them when they\u2019re gone  Maybe you\u2019ll marry, maybe you won\u2019t Maybe you\u2019ll have children, maybe you won\u2019t Maybe you\u2019ll divorce at 40 Maybe you\u2019ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary Whatever you do, don\u2019t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance; so are everybody else\u2019s  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don\u2019t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it. It\u2019s the greatest instrument you\u2019ll ever own  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room  Read the directions, even if you don\u2019t follow them  Do not read beauty magazines; they will only make you feel ugly  [Hook] Brother and sister Together, we'll make it through Someday our spirits Will take you and guide you there I know you've been hurting But I've been waiting to be there for you And I'll be there just helping you out Whenever I can  Get to know your parents; you never know when they\u2019ll be gone for good  Be nice to your siblings; they are your best link to your past and the People most likely to stick with you in the future  Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you Should hold on  Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard  Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft  Travel  Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old-- and when you do, you\u2019ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders  Respect your elders  Don\u2019t expect anyone else to support you  Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out  Don\u2019t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it\u2019s worth  But trust me on the sunscreen  [Hook] Brother and sister Together, we'll make it through Someday our spirits Will take you and guide you there I know you've been hurting But I've been waiting to be there for you And I'll be there just helping you out Whenever I can  Everybody's free Everybody's free Oh, yeah Don't you fear  ",

I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero \"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare!\" First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other \"It's time to fight back,\" that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things change\u2026 and that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Verse 2: 2Pac] I see no changes, all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under, I wonder what it takes to make this One better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right \u2018Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven-sent We ain't ready to see a black president It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way \"I made a G today,\" but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin' crack to the kids \"I gotta get paid!\" \u2014 well hey, but that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Interlude: 2Pac] We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat Let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn't workin' So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive  [Verse 3: 2Pac] And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back \u2018Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years \"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,\" that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Outro: 2Pac] Some things'll never change  ",

That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough To the big dogs living large, taking in light Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS  [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] \"Nas is like.. life or death..

Can't take it with you under this earth Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid Before my number's called, history's made Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die Making choices that determine my future under the sky To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame? Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is  [Chorus: scratches by DJ Premier] \"Nas is like.. life or death..
