Remember how we listened to the radio And I said, \"That's the place to be\"? And how I got the job as an FM jock the day you married me? It was two kids and I was into AM rock, but I just had to run around It's been eight years since I left you, babe Let me tell you 'bout what's gone down  I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D Playing all the hits for you Wherever you may be The bright good morning voice Who's heard but never seen Feeling all of 45 going on 15  The drinking I did on my last big gig It made my voice go low They said that they like the young sounds (Sounds, sounds, sounds) When they let me go  So I drifted on down to Tulsa, Oklahoma To do me a late-night talk show Now I've worked my way down home again Here to Boise, Idaho That's how this business goes  I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D Playing all the hits for you Wherever you may be The bright good morning voice Who's heard but never seen Feeling all of 45 going on 15  I'm making extra money doing high school sock hops I'm the big-time guest MC You should hear me talking to the little children And listen to what they say to me  I got a spot on the top of my head Just begging for a new toupee There's a tire around my gut from sitting on my But it's never gonna go away  Sometimes I get this crazy dream That I just take off in my car But you can travel on 10,000 miles And still stay where you are  Thinkin' that I should stop disc jockin' And start that record store Maybe I could settle down If you'd take me back once more  Okay, honey I see I guess he's better than me Sure, old girl, I understand You don't have to worry, I'm such a happy man  (WOLD) (WOLD) (WOLD) (WOLD)  I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D Playing all the hits for you Wherever you may be The bright good morning voice Who's heard but never seen Feeling all of 45 going on 15  I am the morning DJ at WOLD-D-D-D-D-D WOLD-D-D-D-D-D WOLD-D-D-D-D-D WOLD-D-D-D-D-D WOLD-D-D-D-D-D WOLD-D-D-D-D-D  ",
