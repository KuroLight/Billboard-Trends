So, don't look around Get your feet on the ground It's much better by far To be just who you are  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But just be thankful for what you've got  Many times, it seems to me There's someone else I'd rather be Living in a world of make-believe To stay in bed 'til nearly three With nothing there to worry me Would seem to be the life I might achieve  But deep inside, I know I'm really lucky With happiness I've never known before And just as long as you are there beside me I know that I could ask for nothing more  Then living can start With the love in your heart So, with you all the time All the treasures I've longed for are mine  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But I'm so thankful for what I've got  The other man's grass is always greener The sun shines brighter on the other side The other man's grass is always greener Some are lucky, some are not But I'm so thankful for what I've got  ",
