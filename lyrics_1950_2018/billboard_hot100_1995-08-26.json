See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that? I heard that prom night is a bomb night With the hood rats you can hold tight But really though, I'm a Figaro When I'm in my car, I can't even get a hello Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday Well then I'mma have to get in my car and go You know I take the 110 until the 105 Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, \"Look alive\" 'Cause it's hard to survive when you're living In a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by She looks fly, she looks fly Make me say, \"My, my, my\"  [Hook] I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat And a six four Impala I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat And a six four Impala  [Bridge] I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all I wish I was a baller I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller  [Verse 3] Hey, I wish I had my way 'cause every day would be a Friday And you could even speed on the highway I would play ghetto games Name my kids ghetto names, Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine Yo, you know that's on the real So if you're down on your luck Then you should know just how I feel 'Cause if you don't want me around See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound Hey, you, what's that sound? Everybody look what's going down Ah, yes, ain't that fresh? Everybody wants to get down like that  [Chorus] I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat And a six four Impala I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat And a six four Impala  [Outro] I wish, I wish I wish, I wish I wish, I wish I wish, I wish I wish, I wish I wish, I wish  ",

I'm not livin' in the past You wanna last? Be the first to blast Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets Now he rest in peace Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears  [Refrain] I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears  [Verse 2] Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse God, can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well I know my destiny is Hell\u2014where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears  [Refrain] Lord, I suffered through the years And shed so many tears Lord, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears  [Verse 3] Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step To bring me closer to embrace an early death Now there's nothin' left There was no mercy on the streets I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin' About to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun? Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come  [Refrain] Lord! (God!) I suffered through the years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers  [Verse 4] And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door Shed so many tears  [Refrain] Lord, lost so many peers And shed so many tears I lost so many peers And shed so many tears Lord, I suffered many years And shed so many tears God, I lost so many peers And shed so many tears  ",
