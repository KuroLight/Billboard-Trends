Not all girls want to be involved with bookworms You gotta be strong in a way she can't resist So educated rapper, huh, bust this  Since she's a new girl around the block I had to let her know I was the debonair Doc I said \"I'd like to speak with you if I can And if I'm correct then your name is Roxanne.\" She said \"How'd you know my name?\" I said \"It's getting around Right now baby you're the talk of the town Please let me walk you to the corner, my rap will be brief.\" She said \"I've seen you before, you look like a thief.\" I said \"Me? The Doc? A hood, a rock? Running 'round the street robbing people on the block? Nah, that's not my style, to crime I'm not related As far as I'm concerned I'm too sophisticated.\" Then it seemed I got through 'cause she cracked a smile That let me know my rap was worth her while She said \"You call yourself a doctor?\" I said \"This is true.\" She said \"Explain to me really what doctors must do.\" I said \"This is very rare 'cause I don't say this every day There's a million medical skills a doctor displays Dermatology is treatment of the skin Infected and you'll see me and you'll know you're again There's enthesiology, ophthalmology Internal medicine and plastic surgery Orthopedic surgery and pathology A disease involves a change of your body.\" She said \"Ooooh, that's very unique.\" Gave me her number and kissed me on the cheek She said she had to go but she'd be back by 8 Told me call her at 9 to arrange a date  [EMD] Did you take her to the beach?

[Verse 2] Let us die young or let us live forever We don't have the power but we never say never Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip The music's for the sad men  [Verse 3] Can you imagine when this race is won Turn our golden faces into the sun Praising our leaders we're getting in tune The music's played by the mad man  [Chorus] Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever, and ever Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever young  [Verse 4] Some are like water, some are like the heat Some are a melody and some are the beat Sooner or later they all will be gone Why don't they stay young  [Verse 5] It's so hard to get old without a cause I don't want to perish like a fading horse Youth's like diamonds in the sun And diamonds are forever  [Verse 6] So many adventures couldn't happen today So many songs we forgot to play So many dreams swinging out of the blue We let them come true  [Chorus] Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever, and ever Forever young, I want to be forever young Do you really want to live forever? Forever young  [Outtro] Forever young, I wanna be forever young Do you really want to live forever?
