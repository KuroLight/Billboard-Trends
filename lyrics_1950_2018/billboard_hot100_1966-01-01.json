Use your arms and legs it won\u2019t ruin you How can you say he will haunt you? You can go back to him any time you want to  [Verse 2] He looks so truthful, is this how he feels Trying to peel the moon and expose it With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel If he needs a third eye he just grows it He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk Or pick it up after he throws it  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed Are you frightened of the box you keep him in While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange Their religion of the little tin women That backs up their views but your face is so bruised Come on out the dark is beginning  [Chorus]  ",
