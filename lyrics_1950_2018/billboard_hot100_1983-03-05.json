It isn't fair I don't have enough, now I want my share Can't you see, I wanna live But you just take more than you give  Well, there's a pretty girl serving At the counter of the corner shop She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud She runs to the street and she screams...  What about me? It isn't fair I don't have enough, now I want my share Can't you see, I wanna live But you just take more than you give  More than you give...  Take a step back and see the little people They might be young But they're the ones that make the big people big So listen as they whisper: \"What about me?\"  And now I'm standing on the corner All the world's gone home Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved And I'm feeling cold and alone I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got...
