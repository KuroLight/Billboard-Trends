Alone tonight Yea, you're lonely in love and it don't feel right But you can't walk away with love on the line You still hold on  I told you before, I'll tell you again  Don't take it so hard with your broken heart Don't cry yourself to sleep tonight It's a lonely world, a lonely world. So hold on  Don't take it so hard. Don't take it so hard It's a lonely world. So hold on  ",
