Listen  [Verse 1: Joe Budden] Let me tell you how I pictured this A few houses, a couple businesses Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses And during beef, we both would put aside our differences Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it She a synergy, sharing energy Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me Now here's what I did with it Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks Lost good girls making them mistresses Just savages, missed marriages They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages My worthless self when Joe felt hurt I went out and targeted women who had no self worth I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit Her next sentence swear that I\u2019ll forever hold with a grip She said it go by even faster as the older you get I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss Now neither one of us is how we figured we\u2019d be Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me I always pictured we'd be  [Interlude: Joe Budden] Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though. Ain't quite pan out like that. Word up. Let me tell you about some more of God's work though  [Hook: Stacy Barthe] I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know  [Interlude: Joe Budden] Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run Lemme go right here, right here, right here Look, Look  [Verse 2: Joe Budden] A love that's tideful, never prideful If you're truly better without me how can I spite you? As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there I respect your mom's tutelage But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this? Watch and learn, foolish kid Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am Look, same pedigree, theoretically Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically One job in life to make you a much better me Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it My hands were in bondage, useless Beyond the excuses, calm through it It\u2019s crazy, our bond music And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit So right now I stand in a place I never stood before Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for Now it's better than we pictured it'd be And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it Little nigga we'll be  [Interlude] This is greater than us. Greater than me. Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man. I ain't talking to everbody. Trey, what up though? What up? What up?  [Hook: Stacy Barthe] I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know, ah I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like I wanna know, wanna know  ",

It's not my fault that you made yourself A regretful past But all I know is it makes me look bad When I'm holding your hand and you see Old friends you knew And they walk away laughing calling me a fool Now baby I can't change the things you did before we met Even though I didn't know you But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl I love you So tell me what am I to do  Don't know if we will last And if we do last can I erase the past Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go Don't know if we're meant to be And if we should be can you live faithfully Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go  I think of the night that I made reservations just for two But you gave your attention to someone across the room I should of known right then that things just weren't right But I couldn't see it 'cause love had me so blind  Now tell me how can I be so secure in loving you When everybody's calling me a fool I can't keep holdin' on to broken promises from you I can't take no more from you  Don't know if we will last And if we do last can I erase the past Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go Don't know if we're meant to be And if we should be can you live faithfully Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go  Baby time and time again I tried to overlook the pain Couldn't think of losing all we had to gain Girl if it takes me losing you for happiness in me I think that I might just have to let you go Don't know  So you like playin' those games huh I'ma see how you do When I walk out the door I'm out  Don't know if we will last And if we do last can I erase the past Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go Don't know if we're meant to be And if we should be can you live faithfully Girl can you tell me I don't know Should I stay or let it go  ",

(It's written all over your face, yeah) And the smile you used to wear Seems a little bit out of place (tracks of your tears) People, oh, hold on, in time It gets a little better, oh yeah  [Chorus] My sunshine has come (no more rain in this cloud) (My sunshine) And I'm all cried out And there's no more rain in this cloud (There's no more rain, no, no) My sunshine has come and I'm all cried out And there's no more rain in this cloud (No more rain, no more rain)  [Verse 2] So you want to live and to you I shall give All the space that you requested Hope you don't live to regret it So you say you're in your prime Baby, don't waste your time (no more rain) Remember my love (no more rain) It's only a thin line (too little, too never, too late)  [Chorus] My sunshine has come (no more rain) (My sunshine) And I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out) And there's no more rain in this cloud (no more rain) (There's no more rain) My sunshine has come (no more rain) (My sunshine, no more rain) And I'm all cried out And there's no more rain in this cloud (No more rain in this cloud, no more rain)  [Bridge] Spring has come and winter's gone, my love (No more rain, winter's gone) But don't look around for me, child I'll be gone, gone, gone, gone (I'll be gone, gone, gone) (No more rain) Not afraid (not afraid) Because the seasons have changed I'm gonna count my blessings (no more rain) And just follow the sun 'cause you see  [Chorus] My sunshine has come (Now, I wanna take a minute to kick it like this) (Has come, y'all wit' me?) And I'm all cried out (Y'all know what I'm talkin' about?) And there's no more rain in this cloud (You know what to do, no more rain in this cloud) My sunshine has come (no more rain, no more rain) (There's no hiding place) And I'm all cried out (when you're hurting) And there's no more rain in this cloud (No more rain in this cloud, no, no, no) Baby, don't want tear drops Drying upon my pillow (I used to think the world of you) Only room for raindrops (no more rain) Don't belong on my smile (baby, there's) And there's no more rain in this cloud (Nothing I would not do) Baby, don't want tear drops Drying upon my pillow (You broke me down) Only room for raindrops Don't belong on my smile (You broke me down) (No more rain) And there's no more rain in this cloud (You, you, you, baby, broke me down) My sunshine has come (Goes around, comes around) (What goes up) And I'm all cried out (Must come down) (Things you do) And there's no more rain in this cloud (Come back to you, y'all believe that?)
