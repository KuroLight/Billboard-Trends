Can you hear me or do I, do I need to turn it up? Huh? Huh?  Boy, this evening, was it only me Feeling completely down to be open Down to be open for some satisfaction Didn't wanna say yes, afraid of your reaction  I knew it was wrong for feeling this way Especially the thought of getting in on the first date Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind At the end of the night, I had to decide I was thinking  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night  We were chillin, watching your TV I thought you were coming close as you got to me Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you And somehow in one night, discover I love you  Felt so right but it felt so wrong And look how we are carrying on Try to say things to get me to stay But my watch tells me it's getting too late I'm thinking  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night  (If) If you want me You got to know me And if you want my love You gotta win my love  Hey baby That's the way it's got to be, yeah Get to know me, get to know me So we can do this  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I don't get down on the first night  I should make a move but I won't I know you're probably thinking something is wrong Knowing if I do that it won't be right I wanna get down, but not the first night  ",

Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of taking off my shirt  [Verse 3] It's been one week since you looked at me Threw your arms in the air and said, \"You're crazy\" Five days since you tackled me I've still got the rug burns on both my knees It's been three days since the afternoon You realized it's not my fault not a moment too soon Yesterday, you'd forgiven me And now I sit back and wait til you say you're sorry  [Verse 4: Ed Robertson] Chickity China, the Chinese chicken You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin' Watching X-Files with no lights on We're dans la maison I hope the Smoking Man's in this one Like Harrison Ford, I'm getting frantic Like Sting, I'm tantric Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy Like Kurasawa, I make mad films, okay, I don't make films But if I did they'd have a Samurai Gonna get a set of better clubs Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon 'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes That make me think the wrong thing  [Chorus] How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad? Trying hard not to smile, though I feel bad I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve I have a history of losing my shirt  [Verse 5] It's been one week since you looked at me Dropped your arms to your sides and said, \"I'm sorry\" Five days since I laughed at you and said \"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do\" Three days since the living room We realized we're both to blame but what could we do? Yesterday, you just smiled at me 'Cause it'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry  [Outro] It'll still be two days 'til we say we're sorry It'll still be two days 'til we say \"Wasabi\" Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie  ",

Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close Remember good things come to those who want it most\" So I never left the house, without my rap book Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what? As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, \"Mack\"  [Chorus]  [Mack 10] Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me So call every publication, Billboard and the editor And tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_ I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef Cause now I get down with the North South and the East I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, \"Mack\"  [Chorus]  [Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch Money's just a touch away.. Money's just a touch, just a simple touch Money's just a touch away..  [Mack 10] Man I knew I was gonna make it, but they didn't believe me YaknowhatI'msayin?  Clowned me -- gon' be a rapper, what?
