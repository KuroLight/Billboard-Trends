Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me.\"  [Verse 1] Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it We gon' do it, Lainie\u2014Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever being Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something We have no control over, and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream  [Hook] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh, it's funny)  [Verse 2] I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin' 'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment  [Hook] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright  [Hook 2] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'ma give you the world I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!

It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' {Suge} And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute, \u2018cause\u2014  [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers  [Verse 2] There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated, \u2018cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated \u2014 it ain't just words no more, is it? It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it! Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up \u2018Cause one of the ways I came up Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then! But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc. And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' Off at your jaws, well, then I can, \u2018cause frankly I'm sick of talkin' I'm not goin' to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience \u2018Cause\u2014  [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers  ",
