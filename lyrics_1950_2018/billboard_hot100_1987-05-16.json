Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt\" He turned and said in a real deep voice \"Have it your way if that's your choice And I'll put it down if you want me to put it But don't blame me if it turns into a foot Extending from the middle of your body And the next time you see your cute hottie You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do Would just kick her, so go take karate\" As I turned around to receive my injection I said \"Next time I'll use some protection\" If I see another girl and I get an erection I'm walking in the other direction 'Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor  ",
