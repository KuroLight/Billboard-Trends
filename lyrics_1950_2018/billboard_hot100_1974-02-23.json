Or has time re-written every line? If we had the chance to do it all again Tell me, would we? Could we?  Memories May be beautiful and yet What's too painful to remember We simply choose to forget So it's the laughter We will remember Whenever we remember The way we were  The way we were  ",

My advice is that you leave this place Never come back, and forget you ever saw my face!\"  [Chorus] Dark lady laughed and danced And lit the candles one by one; Danced to her gypsy music Till her brew was done... Dark lady played black magic Till the clock struck on the twelve She told me more about me Than I knew myself...  [Verse 3] So I ran home and crawled in my bed I couldn't sleep because of all the things she said Then I remembered her strange perfume And how I smelled it once in my own room So I snuck back and caught her with my man; Laughing and kissing til they saw the gun in my hand... The next thing I knew they were dead on the floor-- Dark Lady would never turn a card up anymore!

Tell me, tell me, if you think you know What is hip? If you're really hip The question, \"Will it show?\" You're into a hip trip Maybe hipper than hip What is hip?  You became a part of a new breed Been smokin' only the best weed Hangin' out with the so called \"Hippie set.\" Seen in all the right places Seen with just the right faces You should be satisfied, but it ain't quite right  What is hip? Tell me, tell me, if you think you know What is hip? If you're really hip The question, \"Will it show?\" You're into a hip trip Maybe hipper than hip What is hip?  Come on  Hipness is. What it is Hipness is. What it is Hipness is. What it is Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't  You went an' found you a guru In an effort to find you a new you And maybe even raise your conscious level While you're striving to find the right road There's one thing you should know \"What's hip today, might become passe'.\"  What is hip? Tell me, tell me, if you think you know What is hip? If you're really hip The question, \"Will it show?\" You're into a hip trip Maybe hipper than hip What is hip?  Think about it y'all  Hipness is. What it is Hipness is. What it is Hipness is. What it is Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't  What is hip? Ahhhhhhhhh What is hip? I'd like to know What is hip? Is it in the style of your hair? What is hip? Is it in the clothes that you wear? What is hip? I'd like to know What is hip? I'd like to know What is hip? What is hip y'all? Hey What is hip? Hey! Oh What is hip? What is hip y'all? What is hip? I wanna know What is hip? Ahhhhhhh What is hip? I wanna know what hipness is  ",
