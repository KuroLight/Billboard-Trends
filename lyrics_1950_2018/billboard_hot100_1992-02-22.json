Half a million bouncin' to your shit from off the stage '95, I was alive and survived so far Still tryin' to cope with bein' a Rap Star 'Cos that's the type of shit that can really affect your mental This was evident, in the way I broke the tempo With confusion, (I'm havin' Illusions) pain, and hence illusions But I still kept my set up with the critics bein' abusive (yeah) Even the record company, they became illusive When it comes to showin' support for the Cypress institution '96, with no support we were still makin' moves Cypress Hill, in the summer, we were on the Smokin' Grooves But like every legend every clique, someone had to split So the Dog left the house, shit was gettin' kinda thick I was with the electric lady, we was talkin' about babies But the groupies on the road don't help me from misbehavin'  [Hook: Kurupt and B-Real]  [B-Real] '97 was the trip, it was the year we killed the feud Between us and Cube, over shit nobody knew The Dog came back home but after Smokin' Grooves 2 Chillin' with George Clinton and Erykah Badu This was a crazy time, we were flowin' off the boo Niggas on stage, trippin' on the 'shrooms '98 was kinda great, cos it felt just like before We hit the studio, recorded Cypress Hill IV But someone dropped the ball, as I still recall 'Cos it felt Cypress Hill got no support at all We did the last Smokin' Grooves, but did it all with Sen And the old chemistry, just reared it's head again '99 I got to recline, because there was no doubt That the first year was a success, of the Smoke Out '99 was even better than the year of '98 And Skull And Bones was comin' out, kickin' from the gate 2000, 15 million records sold They broke the mould, but there's others along the road But we still keep rollin' on from Heaven to Atlantis Droppin' shit in English and makin' albums in Spanish 2001, goddamn, who knows what's in store?
