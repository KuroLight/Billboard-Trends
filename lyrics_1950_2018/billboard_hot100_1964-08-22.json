When there is always something there to remind me Always something there to remind me I was born to love you, and I will never be free You'll always be a part of me Whoa ohhh whoa  When shadows fall, I passed a small cafe where we would dance at night And I can't help recalling how it felt to kiss and hold you tight Oh, how can I forget you? When there is always something there to remind me Always something there to remind me I was born to love you, and I will never be free You'll always be a part of me Whoa oh whoa, whoa oh whoa  If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share Just come back to the places where we used to go, and I'll be there Oh, how can I forget you? When there is always something there to remind me Always something there to remind me I was born to love you, and I will never be free You'll always be a part of me Whoa ohhhh whoa  (shnana de de shnana) Never love another baby (shnana de de shnana) I never will forget you baby (shnana de de shnana Oh you'll always be a part of me (shnana de de shnana) Whoa, yessir baby (shnana de de shnana) Never never never baby   *le sigh*  <3  Xoxo  ",

Ain't nobody seen Your Johnny Dollar  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  There's a man next door With a radio and he plays it All through the night  There's a couple in the Apartment above my head That don't do nothing But fuss and fight  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  Tell me, where do you go When you got no dough? There must be a way Out of here  But I've got to find Some peace of mind There must be a place That I can find  Believe me when I tell you There's a cat that gets Under my window And he meows all the time  There's a drunk that wakes me In the middle of the night Singing 'Sweet Adeline'  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  I can't get no sleep In this noisy street I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me a quiet place  Oh, I've got to move (I've got to move) I've got to find me A quiet place  I got to get away from This noisy street  ",
