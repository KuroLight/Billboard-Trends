What did I do to you To make you be so cruel? I don't understand why you've been so wrong  I tried to be your strength You said I was too strong I tried to compromise So we could get along I gave my love to you Despite your evil ways I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say  CHORUS  BRIDGE There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart It's telling you that something is strange Ooh Girl you don't have to deny it All you got to do is just try it You'll find our love is stronger if' your willing to change  CHORUS (repeat till end)  ",

Twins...\"  One boy, one girl Two hearts beating wildly To put it mildly it was love at first sight He smiled, she smiled And they knew right away That this was the day they'd waited for all their lives And for a moment The whole world revolved around one boy and one girl  ",
