Thomas & The Triumphs  This is A story about billy and sue They were as in love as were any two And then billy had to die And when you hear the reason why -- You'll hang your head and cry  Billy and sue met the first day of school And ever since lived by the golden rule Because when you do unto others What you wouldn't want done to you You'd have to be A fool  This mutual agreement of love and trust Made them travel the road to marriage or bust And when billy was old enough to take A wife He was old enough to fight for his country--- And his way of life  Bridge- sue's letters came every day Strengthened his cause, they showed him the way To fight for his country and the girl he loves--- That's A soldier's only pay  But then billy heard no more from sue He was worried sick but what could he do The bullets were screamin' as he hugged the ground and back Home sue was runnin' round  Billy was getting less and less strong His hope his faith was almost gone And then like A miracle A letter appeared Billy tore the letter open and it read \"DEAR JOHN\"  A look came over billy that would scare the ghost Of a million single soldiers -- coast to coast And even tho the air was filled with lead Billy jumped up They shot him dead  Billy was buried in A faraway grave that read \"FOR HIS COUNTRY -- HIS LIFE HE GAVE\" But the epitaph -- was only A part He didn't die from A bullet but he died From A broken heart  From: Jb1strat Corrected by Catlady  ",

How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?  [Chorus] The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind The answer is blowin' in the wind  [Verse 2] How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea? How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free? How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?  [Chorus]  [Verse 3] How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky? How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry? How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?  [Chorus]  ",
