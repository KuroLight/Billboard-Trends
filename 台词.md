Motivation

In this project, we are going to investigate the music trends of the billboard hot-100 charts from year 1950~2018. 

During the recent half a century, song styles in the U.S., especially lyrics, have kept changing over the years. Thus, we are more insterested in learning about the trends behind the lurics rather than trends behind artists or titles(song names). 

Specifically, we looked at the differences among word count, average number of vocabulary of all songs and sentimental words for each decade.

Overall, 5 main parts are included in our project:
1. data collection
2. data cleaning/processing
3. lyrics words analysis
4. genre clustering
5. visualization
