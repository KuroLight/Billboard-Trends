Motivation
During the recent half a century, song styles in the U.S., especially lyrics, have kept changing over the years.
In this project, we are going to investigate the music trends of the billboard hot-100 charts from year 1950~2018.

5 main parts are included in our project:
1. data collection
2. data cleaning/processing
3. lyrics words analysis
4. genre clustering
5. visualization
