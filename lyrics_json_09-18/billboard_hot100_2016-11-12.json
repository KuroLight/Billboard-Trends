Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now I hit you up like \"Do you wanna hang right now?\" On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now  [Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR] All she talkin' bout is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\" All she ever say is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\"  [Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR] I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin' Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry Things change, people change, feelings change too Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you You said you never traded no Yeah you said that And I believed you when they told me don't Yeah thought you meant that But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you  [Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR + Drake] Swear these days all you say is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\" All she hit me with is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\"  [Verse 3: Drake] Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start? I know we make time for the things that we want I know you got another nigga tryna play the part Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field If anything should change then I thought we had a deal Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home? That way you can be prepared Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place Or how it's decorated This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now Yeah  [Chorus: Drake] All she talkin' bout is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\" All she hit me with is, \"Come and see me for once Come and see me for once You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me\"  ",
