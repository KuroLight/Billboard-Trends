You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feelin' Yeah, them chills used to get 'em Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em? You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em Throw 'em down, pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know ya 'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over But you promised her, next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me when it comes to love You're just as blinded, baby, please Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time! I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire  [Chorus: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right Because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right Because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie  ",

If you're tryin' to get out, just follow me, I'll get you there.\"  [Verse 1] You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em 'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me So fuck the world, feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he From \"Infinite\" down to the last \"Relapse\" album he's still shittin' Whether he's on salary, paid hourly Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him Whichever comes first, for better or worse He's married to the game, like a \"fuck you\" for Christmas His gift is a curse Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt And fuck the whole Universe  [Hook] I'm not afraid to take a stand Everybody, come take my hand We'll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin' you know that you're not alone Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road  [Verse 2] Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm For you to know it's a wrap You said you was king, you lied through your teeth For that, fuck your feelings Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back I promise to never go back on that promise In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was\u2014ehh Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow 'Cause I ain't playin' around There's a game called circle and I don't know how I'm way too up to back down But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around But it's time to exorcise these demons These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now  [Hook] I'm not afraid to take a stand Everybody, come take my hand We'll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin' you know that you're not alone Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road  [Bridge] And I just can't keep livin' this way So startin' today, I'm breakin' out of this cadence I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground I've had enough, now I'm so fed up Time to put my life back together right now  [Verse 3] It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you So I could come back a brand-new me You helped see me through And don't even realize what you did, believe me you I've been through the wringer But they can do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers And drop dead: no more beef lingers No more drama from now on, I promise To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it \u2018Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up \u2018Cause I'm raisin' the bar I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin', and I'm\u2014  [Hook] I'm not afraid to take a stand Everybody, come take my hand We'll walk this road together, through the storm Whatever weather, cold or warm Just lettin' you know that you're not alone Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road  ",

        "lyrics": "  [Intro: Mike Shinoda] This is not the end, this is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm And though the words sound steady Something empty's within them  We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear  [Verse 1: Chester Bennington] We're waiting for the end to come Wishing I had strength to stand This is not what I had planned It's out of my control  Flying at the speed of light Thoughts were spinning in my head So many things were left unsaid It's hard to let you go  [Chorus: Chester] I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I want to do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  [Verse 2: Chester] Sitting in an empty room Trying to forget the past This was never meant to last I wish it wasn't so  [Chorus: Chester] I know what it takes to move on I know how it feels to lie All I want to do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  [Bridge: Mike] What was left when that fire was gone? I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong All caught up in the eye of the storm And trying to figure out what it's like moving on  And I don't even know what kind of things I said My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin The hardest part of ending is starting again  [Outro: Chester & Mike] All I want to do is trade this life for something new Holding on to what I haven't got  This is not the end, this is not the beginning Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision I'm holding on to what I haven't got But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm Though the words sound steady Something empty's within them  We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there 'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear Holding on to what I haven't got Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear  ",

Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke [Instrumental]  ",
