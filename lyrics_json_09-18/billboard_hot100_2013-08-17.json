A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like, \"Yeah, I'm good at little league.\" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God, aw nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And \"God loves all his children\" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know  [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  [Verse 2: Macklemore] If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? \"Man, that's gay\" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're sayin' Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it \"Gay\" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same, but that's not important No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it  [Trombone Interlude]  [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  [Verse 3: Macklemore] We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on! With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause 'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking 'round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us, we have to change us Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love About time that we raised up!

Cole] They tell me I should fix my grill \u2018cause I got money now I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how My shit is crooked \u2013 look at how far I done got without it! I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell Love yourself, girl, or nobody will Though you a woman I don't know how you deal With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you You wake up, put makeup on Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can\u2019t face what\u2019s wrong No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on Your roommate yelling, \"Why you gotta take so long?!\" What it's like to have a crooked smile  [Hook: TLC] On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (this crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Verse 2: J. Cole] To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling You keep falling victim \u2018cause you're insecure And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure \u2018Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin' So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin' Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care \u2018Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see That the hands can\u2019t touch, that them broads can\u2019t be And that\u2019s you, never let 'em see your frown And if you need a friend to pick you up, I\u2019ll be around And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud I can tell you ain\u2019t laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile  [Hook: TLC] On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Bridge: J. Cole + TLC] Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round) Crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Verse 3: J. Cole] We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens But we got dreams and we got the right to chase \u2018em Look at the nation That\u2019s a crooked smile braces couldn\u2019t even straighten Seem like half the race is either on probation Or in jail, wonder why we inhale, \u2018cause we in Hell already I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele? But one more time for the 'Ville And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let\u2019s make a mil Hey officer man, we don\u2019t want nobody gettin' killed Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now, I'm well now If you askin' will I tell now \u2013 ayy, hell nah I ain\u2019t snitchin' because man, they get them niggas stitches now If you was around, then you wouldn\u2019t need a witness now How you like this crooked smile?  [Hook: TLC] On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Bridge: J. Cole + TLC] Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round) Crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Ad-Libs: Choir]  [Outro: Choir] La la la, la la la, la-la\u2014la\u2014la La la la, la la la, la-la\u2014la\u2014la La la la, la la la, la-la\u2014la\u2014la La la la, la la la, la-la\u2014la\u2014la On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round Back 'round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round Back 'round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Music Video Directed by Sheldon Candis: For Aiyana Stanley-Jones and please reconsider your war on drugs. - A message from J.Cole]  ",
