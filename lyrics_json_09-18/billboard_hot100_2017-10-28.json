I heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave And the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name So when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave? Did I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame? Legend it's exodus searching for euphoria Trudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us Got 20,000 deep off in the street like we some warriors My mama told me never bow your head, woo!

And maybe blow all our money On some sugar at the truckstop and some scratch-offs See if we can lucky? Oh, I gotta know what's goin' on In your beautiful mind Baby don't be shy And tell me now  [Chorus] Do I Make you wanna dance real slow? Go Flyin' down a two lane road? Find A limb to hang your clothes? Do I make you wanna let your hair down? Play a little truth or dare now? Act just like you don't care now? Girl when I come around tell me Do I make you wanna?

See if we can find a cheap flight Little 7, come 11, baby, roll those dice Do I make you feel pretty? Do I make you wanna lean back, lay back and kiss me? Do you wanna roll with me To the mountains, to the beach, to a party in the city? Do you wanna take in a broadway show Or maybe just lay low? I gotta know now  [Chorus] Do I Make you wanna dance real slow? Go Flyin' down a two lane road? Find A limb to hang your clothes? Do I make you wanna let your hair down?
