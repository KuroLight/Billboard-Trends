[Chorus 1: Phillip Carlyle] What if we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine Nothing could keep us apart You'd be the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be So why don't we rewrite the stars? Maybe the world could be ours Tonight  [Verse 2: Anne Wheeler] You think it's easy You think I don't want to run to you But there are mountains And there are doors that we can't walk through I know you're wondering why Because we're able to be Just you and me Within these walls But when we go outside You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all  [Chorus 2: Anne Wheeler] No one can rewrite the stars How can you say you'll be mine? Everything keeps us apart And I'm not the one you were meant to find It's not up to you, it's not up to me When everyone tells us what we can be How can we rewrite the stars? Say that the world can be ours Tonight  [Post Chorus: Both, Anne Wheeler, Phillip Carlyle] All I want is to fly with you All I want is to fall with you So just give me all of you It feels impossible It's not impossible Is it impossible? Say that it's possible  [Chorus 3: Phillip Carlyle and Anne Wheeler] How do we rewrite the stars? Say you were made to be mine? Nothing can keep us apart Cause you are the one I was meant to find It's up to you, and it's up to me No one can say what we get to be And why don't we rewrite the stars? Changing the world to be ours  [Outro: Anne Wheeler] You know I want you It's not a secret I try to hide But I can't have you We're bound to break and My hands are tied  ",
