Does it even really matter? Cause if life is an uphill battle But y\u2019all tryna climb with the same ol\u2019 ladder In the same boat, with the same ol\u2019 paddle Why so shallow? I\u2019m just asking What\u2019s the pattern to the madness? Everybody ain\u2019t a number one draft pick Most of us ain\u2019t Hollywood actors But if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all Then maybe one day, we all can ball Do it one time for the underdogs Sincerely yours, from one of y'all  [Chorus: Taylor Swift] I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us  [Verse 2: B.o.B] I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle You just wanna live, but everything's so low That you could drown in a puddle That\u2019s why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up For all the times no one\u2019s ever spoke for us To every single time that they play this song You can say that that\u2019s what Bobby Ray wrote for us When the tides get too high And the sea up underneath get so deep And you feel like you\u2019re just another person Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds Uh, because we've both been there, both of us But we still stand tall with our shoulders up And even though we always against the odds These are the things that\u2019ve molded us And if life hadn\u2019t chosen us Sometimes I wonder where would've wound up Cause if it was up to me, I\u2019d make a new blueprint Then build it from the ground up, hey But if it\u2019s all for one, and one for all Then maybe one day, we all can ball Do it one time for the underdogs From Bobby Ray, to all of y\u2019all  [Chorus: Taylor Swift] I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us  ",
