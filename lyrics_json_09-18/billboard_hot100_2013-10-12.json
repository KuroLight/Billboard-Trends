A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like, \"Yeah, I'm good at little league.\" A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant For those that like the same sex had the characteristics The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition Playing God, aw nah, here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And \"God loves all his children\" is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago I don't know  [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  [Verse 2: Macklemore] If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me Have you read the YouTube comments lately? \"Man, that's gay\" gets dropped on the daily We've become so numb to what we're sayin' Our culture founded from oppression Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it \"Gay\" is synonymous with the lesser It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference Live on and be yourself When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same, but that's not important No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it  [Trombone Interlude]  [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  [Verse 3: Macklemore] We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on! With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause 'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law Kids are walking 'round the hallway Plagued by a pain in their heart A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all But it's a damn good place to start No law's gonna change us, we have to change us Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love About time that we raised up!  [Hook: Mary Lambert] And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I can't change, even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love, my love, my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  [Outro: Mary Lambert] Love is patient, love is kind Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays) Love is patient (not crying on Sundays) Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)  ",

Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, cause...  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  [Verse 1: Drake] I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  [Verse 2: Drake] Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?

Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie All these 90's fantasies on my mind The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time I might come through without security to check if you're fine That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO Wanted to tell you, \"Accept yourself\" You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help You know, back on your feet and shit Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?  [Outro] If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us  ",
